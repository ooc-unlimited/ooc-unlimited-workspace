# Objection-Handling Scripts
### Battle-Tested Responses for Gary's Top 4 Objections
*Built from real interview patterns + GFI comp structure*

---

## How to Use This

Each objection has:
1. **Why they say it** — the real concern behind the words
2. **The reframe** — how to shift their thinking
3. **Word-for-word script** — conversational, not salesy
4. **Follow-up if they push back** — go deeper without pressure

Read it once, internalize the logic, then make it yours. These aren't meant to be read verbatim — they're frameworks for your natural style.

## Objection #1: "I don't want to pay $199"

### Why They Say It
It's rarely about $199. It's about trust. They've been burned before — MLM, bad opportunities, upfront fees that led nowhere. The $199 is a proxy for "prove this is real."

### The Psychology
- Licensed agents already invested thousands in their license
- $199 is less than one client's premium
- The fee filters out tire-kickers (which is actually a benefit)
- Frame it as an investment with specific ROI, not a cost

### The Script

> "I hear you. And honestly? I respect that. Most people in this industry throw money at stuff that doesn't work. So let me break down exactly what the $199 covers, and you tell me if it makes sense.
>
> That $199 gets you your agent code, your background check, your Ethos website — which is a real, functioning insurance site with your name on it — access to all our carriers, the training platform, and your back office. That's it. No monthly fees. No recurring charges. No hidden costs.
>
> Now here's how I think about it: you already invested time and money getting your license. You didn't do that for fun. The $199 is what activates it. It's the difference between having a license that sits in a drawer and having one that makes money.
>
> And real talk — I've had people tell me $199 is too much, and then I see them spend $300 at dinner that weekend. It's not about the money. It's about whether you believe this is worth it. So let me ask you this: if you knew for a fact this would work, would $199 stop you?"

### If They Push Back

> "That's fair. Let me put it this way — at most insurance companies, you're paying $500-$2,000 just to get started. Some charge monthly desk fees, lead fees, training fees. We don't do any of that. The $199 is a one-time cost, and it's the lowest barrier to entry in this industry. But if it's genuinely a hardship right now, tell me — let's figure it out."

### The Nuclear Option (use sparingly)

> "Here's what I know: the people who hesitate on $199 usually aren't hesitating because of the money. They're hesitating because they haven't decided this is what they want to do. And that's okay — I'd rather you be all-in than halfway. Take a day, think about it, and if you decide this is your move, I'll have everything ready for you. But I'm not going to chase you. You're a grown adult with a license — you know what you want."

## Objection #2: "Where do leads come from?"

### Why They Say It
Every insurance agent has been burned by lead promises. They've heard "we provide leads" and then been told to call their mom. This is a credibility test.

### The Psychology
- They want to know they won't be stranded
- They've probably had a bad experience with another company's "lead system"
- Don't oversell — undersell and overdeliver
- Never mention PropHog (that's your competitive edge, not theirs to know yet)

### The Script

> "Great question — and I'm glad you asked because this is where most companies drop the ball. Let me walk you through how it actually works.
>
> There are four main ways you get clients:
>
> **One — Warm market.** Your friends, family, people you know. I know, I know — everyone hates hearing that. But here's the thing: you're not selling them anything. You're offering them a financial review. Most people have never had someone sit down and actually look at their coverage. You'd be surprised how many people in your phone need what we offer and nobody's ever asked.
>
> **Two — Referrals.** After every client meeting, you ask: 'Who else do you know that might benefit from a conversation like this?' One good client turns into two, turns into four. This is how the top earners in our company generate 70% of their business.
>
> **Three — Your Ethos website.** When you sign up, you get a personal website. People can request quotes directly. You share that link on social media, in your email signature, wherever. It's passive lead generation.
>
> **Four — Digital marketing.** Once you're producing, you can invest in Facebook ads, social media content, community events. We have training on all of that. But that's phase two — you don't need to spend money on marketing to get started.
>
> The real answer? Leads come from YOU being active. The system works when you work it. I'm not going to promise you a magic leads machine — anyone who does is lying to you. What I can promise is a system that generates clients when you follow it."

### If They Push Back

> "I get it — you want certainty. Here's what I can tell you: I personally generated [X clients/Y income] in my first [timeframe], and I didn't buy a single lead. The agents on my team who follow the system are writing business within their first two weeks. But I can't do it for you — I can only show you how."

### Key Rule
**Never reveal PropHog.** That's Gary's sourcing method for recruiting agents, not for client leads. If someone asks about recruiting leads specifically, deflect to the system training.

## Objection #3: "I don't want to build a team — I just want to produce"

### Why They Say It
They've been in MLM-type environments where "building a team" meant doing all the work for people who quit. They want to sell insurance, not manage people. This is actually a reasonable position.

### The Psychology
- Don't fight this. Validate it.
- Show them the math — let numbers do the convincing
- Plant the seed without pushing
- Many top recruiters started as "I just want to produce" people

### The Script

> "I love that. Honestly? The best team builders are producers first. You can't teach what you don't do. So let's start there.
>
> As a producer, here's what your income looks like: You write a family of four — that's roughly $150-$200/month in premium. Your commission on that is about $500-$800 depending on the product. Do that 3-4 times a week, you're looking at $6,000-$12,000/month just from personal production. That's a real income.
>
> Now here's where I'm going to plant a seed — and you can totally ignore it for now. Let's say six months from now, you're writing business consistently and someone in your life says 'Hey, what are you doing? Can I do that too?' If you bring them on and they produce, you earn an override on everything they do. You don't manage them. You don't babysit them. You just get paid.
>
> So here's what I'd say: focus 100% on production. Master the craft. And when the time is right — if it's ever right — the team option is there. No pressure. No timeline. Just an option.
>
> Sound fair?"

### If They Push Back

> "Totally fine. Some of our top earners are pure producers. There's no requirement to recruit anyone, ever. You'll never hear me push you on that. Let's just focus on getting you writing business."

### The Math Card (pull out if needed)

| Path | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Solo Producer** (15 policies/mo) | $90K-$120K | $120K-$150K | $150K+ |
| **Producer + 3 active agents** | $120K-$180K | $200K-$300K | $300K-$500K |
| **Producer + 10 active agents** | $180K-$300K | $400K-$700K | $700K+ |

> "I'm not saying you need to recruit. I'm saying the math changes when you do. But that's your call, not mine."

## Objection #4: "The compensation is too low"

### Why They Say It
They're comparing to captive agencies (State Farm, Allstate) that offer salary + benefits, or they've seen other IMO comp structures that look higher on paper. They may not understand override income, residuals, or the full GFI comp picture.

### The Psychology
- They're looking at first-year commission only
- They don't understand renewals, overrides, or bonuses
- Compare apples to apples: independent vs. captive
- Show them what "too low" actually means when you factor everything in

### The Script

> "What are you comparing it to? I ask because I want to make sure we're looking at the same thing.
>
> [Listen to their answer — this tells you everything]
>
> Okay, so here's how our comp actually works — and it's different from what most people expect:
>
> **First-year commissions:** You're earning 60-80% of first-year premium on most products. On a $200/month policy, that's $1,440-$1,920 per sale. Write four a week, that's $6,000-$8,000/week.
>
> **Renewals:** Every policy you write pays you again in year two, three, four — as long as the client keeps the policy. After two years, you could have $2,000-$5,000/month coming in from renewals alone. That's money you already earned showing up again.
>
> **Overrides:** If you decide to bring on agents (no pressure), you earn a percentage on everything they do. One good agent can add $1,000-$3,000/month to your income without you lifting a finger.
>
> **No ceiling:** There's no cap. No territory. No 'you've hit your quota so slow down.' The more you work, the more you make. Period.
>
> Now compare that to a captive agency: they might offer you a salary — $40-$60K. Maybe a bonus. But you're capped. You're in their system. You sell their products only. And if you leave, you lose your book of business. Here, you own your clients. You're building an asset.
>
> So when you say the comp is too low — low compared to what? Because I'd put our top producers up against any captive agent in the country."

### If They Push Back

> "Fair enough — let me ask you this: what comp structure would make you say yes? Because if there's a specific number in your head, let's work backwards from it and I'll show you exactly how to hit it with our structure. I'm not going to convince you our comp is something it's not. But I think once you see the full picture — commissions plus renewals plus overrides plus bonuses — the math works. It's just not obvious on a one-page comp sheet."

### The Closer

> "Here's the truth: comp sheets are meaningless. What matters is how much money actually hits your bank account. I can show you people on our team who started exactly where you are and are now earning [specific example]. The comp structure isn't the problem. It's whether you work the system."

## Universal Principles

### Before Any Objection
1. **Listen fully.** Don't interrupt. Let them finish.
2. **Validate.** "I hear you" or "That's a fair concern."
3. **Ask a question back.** Understand the real objection.

### During Your Response
4. **Never be defensive.** You're having a conversation, not winning an argument.
5. **Use their words.** If they said "too expensive," use "investment" — not "it's cheap."
6. **Tell a story.** People remember stories, not statistics.

### After Your Response
7. **Check in.** "Does that make sense?" or "How does that land for you?"
8. **Don't over-explain.** Say your piece, then shut up. Silence is your friend.
9. **Move forward.** If they agree, transition immediately: "Great — let's get you set up."

### The Meta-Rule
Every objection is really one of three things:
- **Trust** — They don't trust you yet
- **Fear** — They're scared of failing
- **Timing** — They're not ready (and may never be)

If it's trust or fear, you can work with it. If it's timing, respect it and follow up later.
