# Grand Opening Training: Dajuan (Coach Dewan)
- **Source:** Training class recording transcript
- **Topic:** How to get your business off the ground — Grand Opening / Business Launch

## Core Philosophy
- "Nothing happens until this happens" — Grand Opening is THE launch event
- Restaurant analogy: You invest, you invite everyone, you'll get ALL reactions (love it, hate it, meh, "is this a scam?") — doesn't matter, you don't shut down your restaurant based on opinions
- Grand openings work. If someone says they don't, "Is it not working or are YOU not working?"

## The Numbers
- **Invite 100 guests**
- 50 will say yes
- 25 will show up
- 10 will join (if 25 show) / 5 will join (if only 25 invited)
- "If you want 25 to show up, get a YES from 100 people"

## 10 Preparation Steps
1. **Have a flyer** — Get one made (contact Rona)
2. **Upline sets up the grand opening** — Your recruiter is responsible for logistics, calendar, coordinating with staff
3. **Use the flyer to send invites** — Social media + text + calls
4. **Get phone numbers from social media contacts** — So you can send Zoom link directly
5. **Invite 100 guests** — Make a list of who will attend
6. **Ensure everyone has Zoom** — Correct time zone
7. **Follow up with EVERYONE day prior** — Even those who said they can't come: "Just a reminder, my business launches tomorrow. Your support means the world."
8. **No-shows → Field Training** — Anyone who can't make it, set up a 1-on-1. Send them the recording, then close on Zoom.
9. **Follow up and confirm DAY OF** — Morning of the event, text again
10. **Rehearse the grand opening** — Agent + new agent must practice. No exceptions. No texting during event. Cameras ON.

## Social Media Strategy
- Post flyer on ALL social media, tag everyone
- Put time zones if market is spread out
- End post with: "Please type ATTENDING to confirm"
- Instagram Stories: post daily countdown (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu leading up)
- Have teammates comment/support on your posts → creates FOMO for your friends/family
- "If all our team helps each other on social media, your family sees it and feels FOMO"

## Handling Objections

### "Congrats but can't make it"
→ "Thanks! Aside from my grand opening, I'm up for a promotion. Can I count on you for a practice appointment?"

### "I'm still at work at that time"
→ "I totally understand. Can I count on you to be one of my practice interview appointments?"

### "Send me info"
→ "You making it IS the info" (but don't say that — redirect to field training)

### "I'm not interested"
→ "What exactly are you not interested in? Helping me? I didn't ask you to buy anything. I invited you to support me."

### Nobody shows up
→ Recruit ONE person, take them through the system, set THEIR grand opening. "It still explodes your business."

## Grand Opening Structure

### Agent Intro (< 7 minutes)
- Keep it real, be yourself, DON'T read the corporate script verbatim
- Key points to hit:
  - "I'm excited to be in business"
  - Brief personal story (why you got into this)
  - "I don't need anyone to join or buy — you're here to support me"
  - "When financial services come up, think of us first"
  - "Turn cameras on — my broker is tracking attendance for my promotion"
  - Introduce the trainer: "Boom. Boom. Boom."

### Middle Portion
- Trainer handles the full presentation
- 25+ guests → possibly two trainers (first half: client services/products, second half: opportunity)

### Agent Close
- "Now you see why I'm excited"
- Share personal WHY (Dewan's example: father killed in drive-by at age 6, no life insurance, family washed cars and sold BBQ plates to cover costs)
- "Your promotion is important. Your income is important. Your family is important. YOU are the most important."

## Key Principles

### Accountability
- "Be accountable to me when you have NOTHING going on — that's when I give you feed-forward (direction)"
- "When you have something going on, I give you feedback"
- Accountability is for YOU, not your coach

### Speed & Momentum
- "Success loves speed, speed loves momentum"
- "Overthinking kills dreams"
- Move fast, make wrong decisions, learn, get back on

### Assumptive Closing
- "Thanks for attending my grand opening in 2 hours" — assume they're coming
- Thank people for the future action you expect

### Targeted Grand Openings (for experienced agents)
- Already had one? Do TARGETED ones:
  - "Retirement for police officers"
  - "Financial planning for nurses"
  - Niche-specific events

### Follow-Up is Everything
- Day before: confirm everyone
- Day of: morning text
- No-shows: field training setup
- Post-event: 60 minutes of phone calls for feedback (MOST CRITICAL PHASE)

### Business Math
- 9 pay cycles per month
- $4,000/cycle × 9 = $36,000/month
- $36,000 × 12 = $432,000/year
- "Building this business doesn't take long. You DECIDING you're going to do it is what's taking you a long time."

### MACHO Qualification (from Prince Z — referenced here too)
- Married/divorced/widowed
- Age 28+ with children
- Homeowner
- $50K+ income
- Business owner (bonus)

## Practice
- Use T3 class (Tuesday) to practice grand opening script in front of others
- Leaders should direct their team to attend T3 when they have grand openings coming up

## Post-Grand Opening Follow-Up Scripts

### For No-Shows (THE most powerful script)
"Hey, I'm sorry you missed my grand opening, but you can still potentially help me. I'm up for a promotion. I have to witness 10 field trainings. The good news is I've already seen 7. I just need 3 more. That's why I'm messaging you. Can I count on you?"

**Why it works:** Creates urgency + scarcity (only need 3 more) + makes it about THEM helping YOU, not a sales pitch. The "takeaway" psychology.

**Action:** If you already had a grand opening, make this call 25 times TOMORROW to everyone who didn't attend.

### Alternative Redirects for No-Shows
1. **Company Overview** — Every Saturday 11:00 AM Pacific. Send them there.
2. **Prolific Daily Overview** — Every day 10:00 AM Pacific (1:00 PM Eastern). Most people don't even know this exists.
3. **Send the recording** — Then set up a 1-on-1 field training on Zoom to close.

## Social Media Marketing

### Bio/Profile Optimization
- Your bio should tell people EXACTLY what you do (like Grant Cardone, Myron Golden)
- Examples: "Tax advisor for the culture" / "Helping high income entrepreneurs live tax-free"
- Make it clear, make it niche

### Posting Strategy
- "I'm looking to do some complimentary financial reviews as we head into the new year. My company will sponsor it." — Post this on Facebook
- Even one hit = one appointment
- DON'T stop posting because you only got 2-3 likes early on
- Dewan went from 4-8 likes in 2015 to thousands now — consistency compounds
- Marketing is a volume game — keep flooding the market

### Unique Value Propositions
- Financial planning without fees (vs. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Schwab who charge)
- "Complimentary financial review" positioning
- Money challenges (engagement hooks)
