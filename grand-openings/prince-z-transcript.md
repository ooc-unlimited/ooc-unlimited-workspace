## Key Concepts

### Three Categories of Outreach
1. **Warmest Market** (family, close friends) — Say anything authentic. "Hey, I'm doing a relaunch of my business. Your support would mean the world. Can I count on you?"
2. **Haven't-talked-in-a-while** (old friends, school connections) — DON'T lead with the ask. First rebuild rapport: "Hey [name], it's been forever. You just came to mind. How are you? How's the family?" Wait for them to reply and ask about YOU, then pivot: "I'm doing a very special event coming up. It'll be about 30 minutes. It would mean the world to have your support."
3. **[Third category not covered in this call]**

### Key Rules
- Scripts are TEMPLATES — make them sound like YOU, not Prince Z
- Always end with: **"Can I count on you?"** (yes/no close)
- DON'T post the flyer in Prolific (agent community)
- Registration website is for GUESTS only, not agents
- Platform: **Luma** — install the app, get co-host permissions, track RSVPs
- KPIs to track: Invited → Registered → Attended → Became Client (spreadsheet columns)
- Send **personalized video messages** — "Being different will make you successful"
- If you haven't talked to someone in years, DON'T lead with the event. Rebuild rapport FIRST.
- Don't use GFI Zoom background for client meetings — people Google it, find Reddit negativity, and bounce

### Action Items from Call
- Send minimum 10 outreach messages same day
- Complete Prince Z's certification program (11 modules, 20-30 min)
- Get flyer/website from Chris
- Check with Launa about working with Z
- Track everything on the spreadsheet (tab 2 has checkboxes)

### Prince Z's Approach
- Drip information (don't overwhelm)
- Has a full playbook for grand openings (shared with Gary, password-protected)
- Has post-grand-opening templates for no-shows
- "Matchup system" for after the grand opening
- Very protective of his tools/sauce — doesn't share broadly to avoid dilution
- High energy, direct, low tolerance for drama

## Prince Z Training Notes — Comprehensive Summary

### Accountability and Focus
- Leaders must move forward even when facing backlash
- Once an agent reaches EMD, they're on their own — no more coaching
- "What's next? I'm done. What's next?" = the fastest path to goals
- **Success loves speed, speed loves momentum**
- Must "plug in" to the plug-and-play model for it to work
- Reflection is a big part of winning
- Target: **3-3-30** (3 clients, 3 business partners, 30 days) — NOT the low standard of 1-1-7

### Mindset and Strategy
- Process is designed to make agents uncomfortable — pushes independence
- To earn Z's time: show up, be on time, be committed, execute, follow through
- Red flag: "How can I make as much money as possible in 30 days?" = desperation
- **Overthinking kills dreams** — move fast, make wrong decisions, learn, get back up
- **Business formula: Trust + Credibility = Success** (agent = trust, trainer = credibility)
- Edification: speak highly of your business partner to transfer trust

### Business Structure — Four Wheels
1. Getting licensed
2. Building a team
3. Trainings
4. Targeting a specific audience (**MACHO** acronym)

### MACHO Qualification
- **M**arried, divorced, or widowed
- **A**ge 28+ with children
- **C**hildren — homeowner (H)
- **H**omeowner, makes $50K+/year
- **O**wner of a business (bonus)
- Qualified appointment = meets 4 of 5 criteria

### Best Agent Profiles
- Sales, teaching, entrepreneurship, athletics, military, business ownership
- **Bilingual agents and immigrants make the most money**
- "Immigrant work ethic" — will outwork everyone
- Opportunity: 11,000 baby boomers retiring EVERY DAY

### Working with Clients
- **Never talk products — talk end results/benefits**
- **Never say "life insurance"** — low barrier, abused, scares people
- People want: good night's sleep, tax-free growth, guarantees on money
- "Whoever talks more loses" — stay in control by asking questions
- Never call yourself a financial advisor without securities licenses
- **Words to AVOID:** insurance policies, join, sign up, insurance, life insurance agent, financial adviser, director, executive director

### Grand Opening Details
- "Grand" means LARGE — not a tiny event
- Total event: ~30-40 minutes
- **Agent speaks for less than 7 minutes**
- Trainer does the entire middle portion
- 25+ confirmed → second trainer handles opportunity portion
- Best times: **Wednesday nights, Saturdays (12 or 1 PM)**. Thursdays/Fridays also work.
- Cancel/reschedule = Z drops as trainer
- Virtual grand opening → training appointments → first $1K → first promotion

### Grand Opening Process
- Invitations are fully automated (Z's staff sets up websites, reminders, calendar invites, text messages)
- Agent's job: prepare a list of **at least 300 people** using memory jogger worksheet
- Craft a 2-4 minute story with their "why" (beyond money)
- Day of: join Zoom 30 min early
- **Most critical phase: AFTER the event** — solid 60 minutes of phone calls for feedback
- Invite EVERYONE
