- **Source:** "Separation Saturday" training recording + 11-slide PPTX (image-based)
- **Introduced by:** Bryce Franson (EMD, Arizona, 14 years in financial services)
- **Florio's background:** 11 years in industry, 20 years retail management (Aldo Shoes, Apple Retail, JCPenney) — heavy recruiting background

- **Status:** Top 25 base shop, top 50 super base shop

## Where Grand Opening Fits in the GFI System
1. Onboarding (licensing + internal consumption)
2. Profiling (build list, learn agency building, get "taprooted")
3. Post-licensing (apply to state, set up ETHOR, start field training appointments)
4. **→ GRAND OPENING sits between steps 3 and 4 to ACCELERATE field trainings**
5. Complete 10 Field Training Appointments
6. CFT in progress → Certified Field Trainer
7. Learn to close sales
8. Marketing Director
9. EMD (have an MD on your team)

## The "Why"
- "If your why doesn't make you cry, it's not your why"
- Everything starts with the why — needed to take action (calls, appointments, grand opening)
- Trainers MUST know their teammates' why to move them forward
- Florio & Lauraai's why: "Help fund other people's dreams" — servant leadership

## The Numbers (Bill Britt Quote)
- Showed the plan to 1,200 people
- 900 said No, 300 signed up
- 85 did anything, 35 were serious, **11 made him a millionaire**

## Multiple Ways to Grand Open (not just one way!)

4. Financial workshop at a church (10 attendees)
5. Financial literacy webinar (10 guests)
6. Meeting at your house with trainer/broker (10 guests)
7. 10 guests at company overview (Tue/Wed)
8. Bring people to city tour (Canada, Monterey, Orlando)

## Three-Part Framework
### 1. Marketing (Art of Promotion)
- **Announce:** Professional flyer + professional headshot. "Transformation attracts and creates interest" — before/after GFI look. Social media posts should be universally appealing.
- **Explain:** Post flyer with personalized caption explaining the new venture. Ask for opinions of those you trust.
- **Promote:** Direct individual conversations to invite. Create Zoom meeting + pre-registration link + text template.

### 2. Presentation
- Simple and short — get straight to the point for busy people

### 3. Follow-Up
- Crucial for success — create "sense of urgency"

## The ETHOR Grand Opening Script (Warm Market)
**Message 1:** "Hey [name]... I don't know if you saw my recent post about passing my state financial license exam, and I need your help." → Wait for answer

**Message 2:** "I know we're all extremely busy, and I felt that a Zoom webinar would be a great way for everyone I trust and respect to get an introduction from my mentor and myself as what I made such a big commitment to. I value your opinion and if it makes sense, you can send me referrals in the future." → Wait for answer

**Message 3:** "Well, can I count on you and [Partner's Name] as personal guests on [Date] at [Time]?" → Wait for answer

**If available:** "Thanks. Send me your email and I can have our team register for you."

**If NOT available → PIVOT to field training:** "I totally understand, but since I'm in conversation, I'm not going to miss the opportunity. Would hope I could still count on you for a field training appointment to knock out my training."

**Key insight:** The grand opening's real intention is STILL to get a one-on-one appointment.

## Law of Numbers
- **10 invites** → 6 register → 3 show → 1 moves forward
- **100 invites** → 60 register → 30 show → 10 move forward
- Know this formula so you're NOT disappointed when people don't show

## Bryce Franson's "Fulfillment Formula" — Five Fs
1. **Faith** — Opposite of fear. Faith-based company. Belief in yourself.
2. **Family** — "Family that comes from us is sometimes more important than family we come from"
3. **Finances** — More about mindset than money. Combining GFI with mortgage/real estate.
4. **Fitness** — Physical, mental, spiritual, emotional
5. **Fun** — Enjoy the journey. Trips, retreats, celebrations.
