# New Agent Prospect Worksheet — First 25 Names

*Complete this during CE (NOT after). Your mentor will review it with you.*

---

## Instructions
Write down 25 people you know. Don't overthink it. Don't filter. Don't decide "they wouldn't be interested." Just write names. We're not selling to these people (yet). We're starting conversations.

**Categories to jog your memory:**
- Family (parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws)
- Friends (close friends, old friends, gym buddies, sports teammates)
- Work (current/former coworkers, old bosses, business contacts)
- Community (church, school parents, neighbors, barber/hairstylist)
- Social (social media connections you actually talk to)

## Star Your Top 5

Go back and put a ⭐ next to the 5 people most likely to **listen** (not buy). These are your first conversations.

**Criteria for Top 5:**
- They trust you
- They'd take your call
- They care about their family's financial future
- They're open-minded enough to hear you out

## The "3 Good Qualities" Approach Script

For each Top 5 person, practice this opener:

> "Hey [Name], I just started working with a financial services company and part of my training is to practice with people I respect. I thought of you because [3 qualities — e.g., you're smart with money, you care about your family, and you're always open to new things]. Would you be willing to give me 20 minutes and some honest feedback?"

### Why this works:
1. You're complimenting them (3 qualities)
2. You're asking for HELP, not selling
3. You're setting a time limit (20 minutes)
4. You're being honest (you're practicing)
5. Low pressure = higher yes rate

## After Each Conversation: Ask for 3 Referrals

> "Thanks for your time. Whether or not this was right for you, can you think of 3 people who might benefit from learning about this? Maybe someone who's been thinking about their financial future, or someone who might be interested in the career opportunity?"

**Write their referrals here:**

| From | Referral Name | Phone | Contacted? | Result |
|------|--------------|-------|------------|--------|
| | | | ☐ | |
| | | | ☐ | |
| | | | ☐ | |
| | | | ☐ | |
| | | | ☐ | |
| | | | ☐ | |
| | | | ☐ | |

*Your pipeline is your lifeline. 25 names → 5 conversations → 15 referrals → endless pipeline. This is how the top agents never run out of people to talk to.*
