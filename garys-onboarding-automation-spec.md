## Last Updated: 2026-02-10

---

## TRIGGER
ICA submitted + $199 paid
- Detected via: email notification OR Gary texts Donna manually ("signed [Name]")
- Donna confirms and kicks off automation

---

## STEP 1: IMMEDIATELY (Minute 0)
- **Welcome text from Ringy** (321-386-6527)
  - Content TBD — warm welcome, set expectations
- **Donna alerts Gary on Telegram**: "New ICA: [Name] — automation started"

---

## STEP 2: WITHIN 1 HOUR — "Expect the Pushback" Email
All text, beautifully formatted. Contains:
1. **Inoculation content** — how friends/family will react to their decision, how to handle it
2. **Building an Empire audiobook link**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZsPw1zyX104g9w7RINqBMSYHxhnhIAxW/view?usp=sharing
   - Instruction: "Listen to some of this before our next meeting"
3. **Calendly link to book CE Part 1**: https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/bookings/gary-cosby-jr-personal-calendar-kd5a-po0d

---

## STEP 3: CE PART 1 (Within 48 hours — Gary runs live on Zoom)

### Path A: NOT Licensed
- Study prep materials
- Connect with licensing department (Karren)
- Schedule their licensing exam
- Then proceed to onboarding slides when licensed

### Path B: Already Licensed (Gary's typical recruit)
1. Onboarding 1 slides (internal consumption)
2. Agency Rocket webinar
3. Tevah — digital Personal Financial Review (PFR)
4. **Before hanging up**: Income protection policy using **Ethos**

**No role play in CE Part 1.**

---

## STEP 4: CE PART 2 (Within 48 hours of CE Part 1)
1. Review their numbers from PFR
2. Retirement plan using Agency Rocket comparison tool
3. Close business — internal consumption
4. Schedule Onboarding 2 before hanging up

---

## 7-DAY FILTER
- Applied from ICA date
- "Engaged" = listened to some of Building an Empire (did their homework) AND attended onboarding school
- If not engaged in 7 days → deprioritize (don't mute, match with someone else)

---

## STEP 5: ONBOARDING 2 — Hands-On Training (HOT)
- Can be run by **CFTs** (Certified Field Trainers), not just Gary
- 20 minutes to 1 hour daily
- **The 7 Fundamentals:**
  1. Phone call
  2. Edify
  3. Conversation
  4. Answer questions
  5. Product knowledge
  6. Clo"Z"ing
  7. Duplication
- Role play, role play, role play — "you say it, I say it"

---

## STEP 6: FIELD TRAINING
- Scheduled through calendar link
- Run by Gary + sidelines/uplines
- Number before independence varies per person
- Real appointments, real exposure
- "The faster I get people to exposures, the less skepticism they have"

---

## ONGOING AUTOMATION
- **PhoneZones**: Mondays 8 PM EST
- **Text reminders from Ringy** at each milestone transition
- **Donna tracks pipeline** — alerts Gary if someone stalls >24 hours without a next step
- **Milestone texts**: After each step, auto-send next step instructions + scheduling link

---
