# Post-SMS Drop-Off Diagnosis & Fix
### Why 86% of Gary's Leads Go Silent After the First Text
*Gary's biggest pipeline leak — diagnosed and prescribed*

---

## The Problem

Gary's pipeline flow: **PropHog → Ringy → SMS drip → ???**

That "???" is where most leads die. Of 70 ICA'd agents in Ringy, only 14% ever got a phone call. But even before ICA, the SMS response rate is likely under 10%. The vast majority of leads never respond to the first text.

This is the single highest-leverage fix in Gary's entire system.

---

## Why Leads Don't Respond

### 1. Generic First Message
If the first text reads like a mass blast, it dies on arrival. Licensed agents get dozens of recruiting messages. They can smell automation.

### 2. No Hook
"Are you interested in a new opportunity?" is not a hook. It's a delete trigger. There's no curiosity, no value proposition, no reason to type back.

### 3. Too Much Too Soon
Sending a wall of text about GFI comp structure in message #1 is the SMS equivalent of proposing on the first date.

### 4. No Follow-Up Cadence
One text → silence → move on. That's not a system, that's a hope strategy. Most sales happen between the 5th and 12th contact.

### 5. Wrong Channel for the Ask
SMS is for starting conversations, not closing deals. The goal of text #1 is to get text #2, not to get an ICA.

## The Fix: 7-Day SMS Sequence

### Design Principles
- **First text = curiosity, not pitch**
- **Each text has ONE job: get a response**
- **Personalize with their name and state**
- **Mix value, social proof, and direct asks**
- **Always end with a question (questions get replies)**

---

### Day 1 — The Opener (Send within 1 hour of import)

**Version A (Curiosity):**
> Hey [Name], saw you're licensed in [State]. Quick question — are you currently with a team or independent? 🤙

**Version B (Value-first):**
> Hey [Name], I work with licensed agents in [State] who want to increase their income without buying leads. Is that something you'd want to hear about?

**Version C (Direct):**
> Hey [Name] — Gary here. I'm building a team of licensed agents and came across your profile. Got 2 minutes for a quick question?

**Why these work:** Short. Personal. End with a question. Don't pitch anything.

---

### Day 2 — The Follow-Up (if no response)

> Hey [Name], following up from yesterday. No pressure at all — just curious if you're open to exploring something new, or if you're locked in where you are? Either way is cool. 👊

**Why:** Acknowledges the previous text without being pushy. Gives them an easy out (which paradoxically increases replies).

---

### Day 3 — The Value Drop

> Fun fact: the average licensed agent changes companies 2-3 times in their first 5 years. The ones who find the right team early skip the revolving door. If you're curious what "right team" looks like, I'll send you a quick 10-min overview. Just say the word.

**Why:** Social proof + education. Positions you as the solution without pitching.

---

### Day 5 — The Story

> When I started in this industry, I was $100K in debt and had zero warm market. Nobody trained me. I figured it out the hard way. Now I make sure nobody on my team goes through that. If you're tired of figuring it out alone, let's talk. If not, no worries.

**Why:** Gary's origin story is his superpower. Authenticity cuts through noise.

---

### Day 7 — The Breakup

> Last one from me, [Name]. I don't chase people — that's not my style. If you're ever looking for a team that actually trains and supports their agents, my number's right here. Wishing you the best either way. 💯

**Why:** Scarcity + respect. "I'm not going to bother you anymore" often triggers a response because the pressure is removed.

---

### Day 14 — The Ghost Revival (if still no response)

> Hey [Name], random question — still in the insurance game? No pitch, just genuinely curious.

**Why:** Two weeks of silence resets the dynamic. A casual, non-threatening check-in often reopens the conversation.

---

### Day 30 — The Long Game

> [Name] — haven't heard from you in a while. Hope business is good. If you ever want to explore what we're building over here, the door's always open. Either way, keep crushing it. 🤙

---

## iDecide Link Placement Strategy

**DO NOT send iDecide in the first 3 messages.** It's too early. They haven't opted in.

**When to send iDecide:**
- After they respond positively to any message
- As the "10-min overview" referenced in Day 3
- During or after the first phone call
- Never cold — always in context

**How to frame it:**
> "I'll send you a quick interactive overview — it's like 10 minutes and covers everything better than I can over text. Take a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think."

**After sending iDecide:**
- Follow up 24 hours later: "Did you get a chance to check out that overview?"
- If yes → schedule Zoom
- If no → gentle nudge at 48 hours, then move on

## Ghost Revival Scripts (For Leads That Went Cold)

### The "Check-In" (30+ days cold)
> Hey [Name], it's Gary. We chatted a while back about [topic/company]. Just checking in — how's everything going on your end?

### The "News Hook" (tie to industry news)
> Hey [Name], don't know if you saw, but [relevant industry news — new carrier, comp change, market shift]. Made me think of our conversation. Still in the game?

### The "Social Proof" (name-drop results)
> [Name], one of the agents I brought on [X weeks] ago just closed their first [deal/amount]. Starting to see why I was so excited to talk to you. Door's still open if you're interested.

### The "Honest" (vulnerability play)
> Hey [Name], I'll be straight with you — I probably didn't do a great job explaining what we do over text. Would you be open to a 5-minute call? No pitch, just a real conversation. If it's not for you, I'll respect that completely.

## A/B Testing Framework

### What to Test
1. **Opener style:** Curiosity vs. Value-first vs. Direct
2. **Timing:** Morning (9-11 AM) vs. Afternoon (2-4 PM) vs. Evening (6-8 PM)
3. **Follow-up cadence:** 1-3-5-7 days vs. 1-2-3-5-7 days
4. **Message length:** 1-2 sentences vs. 3-4 sentences
5. **Call-to-action:** Question vs. Statement vs. Offer

### How to Measure
For every 50 leads imported:
- **Response rate:** % that reply to any message (target: 15-25%)
- **Conversation rate:** % that engage in 2+ message exchange (target: 10-15%)
- **Call rate:** % that get on a phone/Zoom call (target: 5-10%)
- **ICA rate:** % that sign ICA (target: 2-5%)

### Tracking Template

| Batch | Date | Count | Opener | Response % | Convo % | Call % | ICA % |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | | 50 | Curiosity A | | | | |
| 2 | | 50 | Value B | | | | |
| 3 | | 50 | Direct C | | | | |

**Review weekly. Double down on what works. Kill what doesn't.**

## Benchmarks

| Metric | Bad | Average | Good | Elite |
|--------|-----|---------|------|-------|
| SMS Response Rate | <5% | 10-15% | 20-30% | 30%+ |
| Response → Call | <10% | 20-30% | 40-50% | 50%+ |
| Call → ICA | <10% | 20-30% | 40-50% | 50%+ |
| Overall SMS → ICA | <0.5% | 1-3% | 3-5% | 5%+ |

Gary's current estimated flow: probably ~3-5% response rate, <1% SMS-to-ICA. The goal is to 3-5x response rate with better copy and cadence.
