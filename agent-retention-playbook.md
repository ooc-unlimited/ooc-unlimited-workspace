# Agent Retention Playbook — OOC Unlimited

*"Recruiting without retention is just expensive cardio."*

---

## The Problem (Your Numbers)

| Metric | Industry Avg | OOC Current | OOC Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 4-Year Stick Rate | 15% | ~5-10% | 25%+ |
| 90-Day Survival | ~50% | Unknown | 75%+ |
| Time to First Check | 30-60 days | Unknown | ≤14 days |
| Multi-Line Agents | ~40% | Low | 80%+ |

**The math:** Moving from 10% → 20% retention with 10 recruits/month = 12 extra productive agents/year. At DC's minimums (10K pts/mo), that's $72K+ in additional annual cash flow.

## The 90-Day Retention System

### Phase 1: Identity Lock (Days 1-7)
**Goal:** Agent sees themselves as a financial professional, not "trying something."

| Day | Action | Owner | Tool |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 0 | ICA signed → Welcome SMS fires | Auto (GHL) | Workflow |
| 0 | "Expect the Pushback" email sent | Auto (GHL) | Email |
| 1 | Personal welcome call from Gary (5 min max) | Gary | Phone |
| 1 | Assign mentor (NOT Gary — someone in downline) | Stacy | GHL Tag |
| 2 | Mentor check-in #1: "How did your family react?" | Mentor | Text/Call |
| 3 | CE Part 1 booked (Gary books on welcome call) | Gary | Calendar |
| 5 | Agent joins team group chat + Discord | Stacy | Discord |
| 7 | Mentor check-in #2: "Tell me about your WHY" | Mentor | Text/Call |

**Key Script for Day 1 Call:**
> "Hey [NAME], I want you to know something — the fact that you're here puts you in the top 5% of people who actually do something about their situation. Most people just keep scrolling. You didn't. That tells me something about you."

### Phase 2: Confidence Build (Days 8-30)
**Goal:** First check by Day 14. Agent can explain IUL in plain English.

| Day | Action | Owner | Tool |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 8 | CE Part 1 complete | Agent | |
| 10 | CE Part 2 scheduled | Agent/Stacy | Calendar |
| 10 | Identify first 5 prospects (during CE, not after) | Matt/Mentor | Worksheet |
| 12 | HOT (Hands-On Training) — shadow a senior agent | Gary/Senior | Zoom/In-person |
| 14 | **FIRST APPOINTMENT** (3-way with senior agent) | Agent + Senior | iDecide |
| 14 | **TARGET: First check earned** | Agent | |
| 21 | Mentor check-in #3: "What objections are you hearing?" | Mentor | Call |
| 21 | Role-play session: top 5 objections | Matt | Zoom |
| 28 | Second product intro (if started with term → intro IUL) | Austin/Doug | Training |
| 30 | **30-Day Review:** Assess, celebrate, course-correct | Gary | Zoom |

**Critical Rule:** Do NOT wait until "independent" to schedule first appointments. The confidence collapse happens in the gap between training and action. Close that gap.

### Phase 3: Momentum Lock (Days 31-90)
**Goal:** Agent has recurring production rhythm and can't imagine going back.

| Day | Action | Owner | Tool |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 31-60 | Weekly accountability call (non-optional) | Matt | Zoom |
| 35 | Third product line intro (WL or FE) | Chris | Training |
| 45 | Grand Opening prep begins | Agent + Team | System |
| 60 | **Grand Opening event** | Agent | |
| 60 | First recruiting conversation coached | Gary | |
| 75 | Agent identifies their first recruit | Agent | |
| 90 | **90-Day Review:** Production stats, next-level plan | Gary | Zoom |

## The Early Warning System (GHL Automation)

### At-Risk Signals to Track

| Signal | Trigger | Action | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| No CE scheduled | Day 5 with no booking | Stacy calls | Immediate |
| Missed training call | 2 consecutive misses | Mentor outreach | Within 24h |
| No prospects identified | Day 14 with empty pipeline | Gary intervention | Same day |
| No activity in 72h | GHL tag: stalled | Auto SMS + mentor call | Auto |
| First month: $0 earned | Day 30 review shows no production | Emergency 1:1 | Same week |

### GHL Tags for Retention Tracking

```
retention-phase-1 (Days 1-7)
retention-phase-2 (Days 8-30)
retention-phase-3 (Days 31-90)
retention-graduated (Day 90+)
retention-at-risk (any warning signal)
retention-rescued (was at-risk, re-engaged)
retention-lost (ghosted, confirmed exit)
```

## The Mentor Program

### Who Can Be a Mentor
- Must have closed at least 5 deals
- Must be past their own 90 days
- Must be willing to commit to scheduled check-ins
- Ideally NOT the person who recruited the agent

### Mentor Responsibilities
1. **6 scheduled touchpoints:** Day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30
2. **Weekly text check-in** after Day 30 through Day 90
3. **Emotional management** — their job is to normalize the struggle, not teach product
4. **Escalation** — flag to Gary/Stacy if agent shows at-risk signals

### Mentor Script Templates

**Day 3 Text:**
> "Hey [NAME]! Just checking in. Quick question — have you told anyone yet about what you're doing? What was their reaction? (Don't worry, whatever they said, it's normal. I'll tell you what happened to me when you're ready 😂)"

**Day 14 Text:**
> "2 weeks in! How are you feeling? Scale of 1-10, how confident are you about sitting in front of a client? (Be honest — there's no wrong answer, and wherever you are is exactly where you should be at this stage.)"

**Day 21 Text (if no production yet):**
> "Real talk — have you had any appointments yet? If not, that's okay, but let's figure out what's blocking it. The hardest part isn't learning the product. It's picking up the phone. What if we set up one appointment together this week? I'll walk you through it."

## The Weekly Accountability Call

**Format:** 15 minutes, every Monday at a set time, non-optional for first 90 days.

**Agenda (same every week):**
1. **Wins** — What went right? (Even small wins count) [2 min]
2. **Commitments check** — What did you commit to last week? Did it happen? [3 min]
3. **Obstacles** — What's in your way? (Coach through, don't just listen) [5 min]
4. **This week's commitments** — 3 specific, measurable actions [3 min]
5. **Close** — Motivational anchor + confirm next call [2 min]

**Rule:** If agent misses 2 consecutive calls without rescheduling → retention-at-risk tag → Gary gets notified.

## Monthly Retention Metrics (Track in Weekly Scorecard)

| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|---------------|
| 30-Day Survival Rate | Agents still active at Day 30 / New agents that month |
| Time to First Check | Average days from ICA to first commission earned |
| CE Completion Rate | Agents who complete CE within 14 days / Total new agents |
| First Appointment Rate | Agents who have first appointment by Day 14 / Total |
| Mentor Contact Rate | Scheduled touchpoints completed / Total scheduled |
| At-Risk Rescue Rate | Agents tagged at-risk who re-engaged / Total at-risk |

## The Big Insight

> **91% retention for multi-line agents vs. 67% for single-line.** That's a 24-point gap. Train agents on multiple products early — not after they're "ready." Each product they learn is another anchor keeping them in the business.

Your onboarding progression should be:
1. **Week 1-2:** Term life (simplest, fastest to close)
2. **Week 3-4:** IUL (the big earner, F&G Pathsetter)
3. **Month 2:** Whole Life / Final Expense (Chris's domain)
4. **Month 3:** Annuities, advanced planning
