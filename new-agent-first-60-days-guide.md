# Your First 60 Days — New Agent Survival Guide
## OOC Unlimited × GFI

*Welcome to the team. This guide is your roadmap. Follow it step by step and you'll be ahead of 85% of agents in the industry.*

---

## Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-7)

### ✅ Day 1 Checklist
- [ ] Read "Expect the Pushback" email (check your inbox)
- [ ] Save Gary's number: (321) 386-6527
- [ ] Save your mentor's number: ________________
- [ ] Join the team group chat (link in welcome SMS)
- [ ] Download the Ethos app on your phone
- [ ] Write down your **WHY** — not just "money." What SPECIFICALLY changes when you succeed?

### ✅ Days 2-3: Get Your CE Scheduled
- [ ] Book CE Part 1 with Gary (he'll send the link)
- [ ] Start studying — you need to PASS, not just attend
- [ ] Tell ONE person you trust what you're doing (prepare for pushback — it's normal)

### ✅ Days 4-7: Identity Shift
- [ ] Update your LinkedIn headline to include "Financial Professional" or "Financial Services"
- [ ] Read one article about life insurance (your mentor will send you one)
- [ ] Complete CE Part 1
- [ ] Your mentor will text you — **respond.** They're not checking on you to be nosy. They survived the same first week.

**🚨 WARNING:** This is when most agents ghost. The excitement fades. The doubts creep in. That voice saying "maybe this isn't for me" is LYING. It says that about everything that matters. Push through it.

## Week 2: Learn by Doing (Days 8-14)

### ✅ Days 8-10: CE Part 2 + Prospect List
- [ ] Complete CE Part 2
- [ ] Write down 25 people you know (friends, family, coworkers, gym buddies, church members, neighbors)
- [ ] Circle the 5 most likely to **listen** (not buy — just listen)
- [ ] Schedule your HOT (Hands-On Training) with a senior agent

### ✅ Days 11-14: Your First Appointment
- [ ] Shadow a senior agent on a real client meeting (observe, don't sell)
- [ ] Debrief with your mentor: What did you notice? What surprised you?
- [ ] **Schedule YOUR first appointment** — a 3-way with a senior agent present
- [ ] 🎯 **TARGET: Earn your first check by Day 14**

**Your first appointment doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to HAPPEN.**

The senior agent will do the heavy lifting. You're there to learn, to start building the muscle, and to realize: *"Wait... I can actually do this."*

## The Objections You'll Face (And What to Say)

### From Prospects:
| They Say | You Say |
|----------|---------|
| "I already have life insurance" | "That's great! Most people are actually underinsured though. Would it be okay if I just did a quick review to make sure you have the right coverage? No pressure at all." |
| "I can't afford it" | "I hear that a lot, and honestly, most people find that the right plan actually fits into what they're already spending. Can I show you what I mean? It takes about 15 minutes." |
| "I need to talk to my spouse" | "Absolutely, you should! In fact, would it be helpful if I was there when you talk about it? That way I can answer any questions they have directly." |
| "Is this one of those pyramid things?" | "Ha! I get that question a lot. No — I'm a licensed financial professional. I work with companies like Prudential, Allianz, F&G. I help families with life insurance, retirement planning, and wealth building. Think of me like an independent financial advisor." |

### From Family/Friends:
| They Say | You Say |
|----------|---------|
| "Be careful..." | "I appreciate you looking out for me. I've done my research, I'm properly licensed, and I'm working with a team that's been doing this successfully. I'll keep you posted on how it goes." |
| "How much are you making?" | "I'm investing in building something long-term. The first few months are about learning and building, just like any business. Ask me again in 6 months." |

## The Mindset Rules

1. **Speed beats perfection.** A decent appointment today beats a perfect one next month.
2. **Activity solves everything.** Feeling down? Make 5 calls. Feeling uncertain? Book an appointment. Action cures fear.
3. **Your first 10 appointments will be rough.** That's normal. Your next 10 will be better. Your next 10 after that will be natural.
4. **Celebrate every win.** First appointment. First "no." First "yes." First check. They all matter.
5. **The people who quit were one conversation away from their breakthrough.** Don't be that person.

---

## Emergency Contacts

**If you're thinking about quitting:** Call your mentor FIRST. Not tomorrow. Right now. Every single successful agent on this team had a moment where they almost quit. The difference? They made one more call.

**If you have a compliance question:** Ask Gary or your mentor BEFORE doing anything you're unsure about.

**If something personal comes up:** Life happens. Tell your mentor. We'd rather adjust your timeline than lose you.
