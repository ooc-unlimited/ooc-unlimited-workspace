# 🎉 Grand Opening Automation System
### Prince Z-Style, Fully Automated via Luma
*Spec v1.0 — February 9, 2026*

---

## Vision
A new prospect provides their social media info → we handle EVERYTHING:
- Auto-create event on Luma
- Auto-invite their warm market contacts
- Auto-send reminders
- Auto-follow-up after event
- Gary just shows up and presents

**Inspired by:** Prince Zeeshan Ali's automated grand opening system + Dajuan's FOMO/social proof + Florio's multi-pathway approach.

## The Three Grand Opening Models (Captured Feb 8)

### Prince Z 🏆 (Gary's Preferred — Automated Foundation)
- **Platform**: Luma
- **Scale**: 300-person invite list
- **Method**: Certification program, drip info, automated reminders
- **Key**: Prospect just provides socials → everything else is handled
- **Strength**: Maximum automation, minimal manual effort

### Dajuan (Coach Dewan) — Energy + Accountability
- **Funnel**: 100 invites → 50 confirmations → 25 show up → 10 sign up
- **Method**: High-energy, social media FOMO, accountability groups
- **Key**: Restaurant analogy (grand opening buzz), constant social proof
- **Strength**: Creates massive urgency and excitement

### Florio (Florio & Lauraai Mazares) — Systematic Multi-Path
- **Method**: 11 ways to grand open (not just one event type)
- **Conversion**: 10 invites : 6 confirmations : 3 attend : 1 signs up
- **Key**: ETHOR script, three-part framework (Marketing → Presentation → Follow-up)
- **Strength**: Multiple pathways catch different personality types

## Gary's Grand Opening System (Hybrid)

### Phase 1: Pre-Event (Weeks 1-3)

#### Step 1: New Agent Signs ICA
- Agent provides: name, email, phone, social media handles (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- **Donna auto-creates**: Luma event page with agent's name featured
- Template: "Welcome [Agent Name] to [GFI/Team Name] — Grand Opening Celebration"

#### Step 2: Contact List Extraction
- Agent provides their top 25-50 contacts (name + phone/email)
- **OR** agent connects Facebook → we scrape their friend list for warm contacts
- **OR** manual: agent texts us 10-25 names with numbers

#### Step 3: Luma Event Creation (Automated)
```
Event Title: "[Agent Name]'s Grand Opening — An Exclusive Introduction"
Date: 7-10 days after ICA
Time: 7:00 PM EST (Zoom)
Host: Gary Cosby
Co-host: [Agent Name]

Description:
"You've been personally invited by [Agent Name] to an exclusive look at 
a financial services opportunity that's changing lives. Join us for a 
30-minute presentation followed by Q&A. Dress: casual. Vibe: electric."
```

#### Step 4: Invitation Sequence (Automated via Luma + SMS)

| Day | Channel | Message |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Day 0 | Luma Email | Event invitation with personalized message from agent |
| Day 0 | SMS (Ringy) | "[Agent] invited you to something special next [Day]. Check your email — or just RSVP here: [link]" |
| Day 3 | Luma Email | "Reminder: [Agent]'s Grand Opening is in 4 days. 73 people are already registered." (social proof) |
| Day 5 | SMS | "Hey [Name], just wanted to make sure you saw [Agent]'s invite. Quick 30 min Zoom on [Day]. Worth your time. [link]" |
| Day 6 | Luma Email | "Tomorrow night! Here's your Zoom link. [Agent] is excited to have you there." |
| Day 6 | SMS | "See you tomorrow at 7! [Agent]'s grand opening. Zoom link: [link]" |
| Day 7 | SMS (1hr before) | "Starting in 1 hour! Jump on: [link]" |

#### Step 5: Social Proof Engine (Dajuan-Inspired)
- After each RSVP, auto-post to agent's social: "🔥 [X] people registered for my Grand Opening!"
- Create Instagram/Facebook story templates with countdown
- Daily count updates: "23 registered... 45 registered... 67 registered..."
- Testimonial clips from existing agents: "Here's what changed for me..."

### Phase 2: The Event (Day 7)

#### Pre-Event (30 min before)
- Zoom room opens with welcome screen + Yacht Soul music
- Me-Lin manages breakout rooms, recording, tech
- Early arrivals see: professional welcome slide, ambient music, chat prompt

#### The Presentation (30 min)
1. **Agent's Story** (3 min) — Why they joined, what excites them
2. **Gary's Story** (5 min) — The journey from broke to $12K checks
3. **The Opportunity** (10 min) — iDecide presentation (customized for agent's guests)
4. **Social Proof** (5 min) — 2-3 testimonials from active agents
5. **The Close** (7 min) — Papa Kapp urgency: "I have spots filling up this week..."

#### Close Script (Florio ETHOR-Inspired)
- **E**stablish rapport (done via agent's intro)
- **T**ell your story (Gary's story)
- **H**ear their story (brief Q&A)
- **O**ffer the solution (ICA + $199)
- **R**ecruit to invite (their contacts → next grand opening)

### Phase 3: Post-Event Follow-Up (Automated)

| Timing | Channel | Message | Target |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| +1 hour | SMS | "Great meeting you tonight! Any questions? Reply here or book a 1-on-1: [Calendly]" | All attendees |
| +1 hour | Email | Event recording + recap + CTA to schedule call | All attendees |
| +24 hours | SMS | "Hey [Name], the people who joined last night are already getting started. Spots on [Agent]'s team are filling up. Ready to grab yours?" | Non-converts |
| +48 hours | Phone call | Personal call from Gary or agent | Hot prospects (stayed to end, asked questions) |
| +72 hours | SMS | "Last chance: [Agent]'s team launch offer expires Friday. After that, new agents go under whoever joins next." | Non-converts |
| +7 days | Email | "What [Agent] accomplished in their first week..." + results | All attendees |

#### No-Show Follow-Up
| Timing | Channel | Message |
|--------|---------|---------|
| +1 hour | SMS | "Missed you tonight! No worries — I saved the recording for you: [link]. Watch when you can, it's only 30 min." |
| +3 days | SMS | "Did you get a chance to watch? [X] people from the event already started. Wanted to make sure you didn't miss out." |
| +7 days | SMS | Ghost revival script (from sms-drop-off-diagnosis.md) |

## Luma Integration Research

### What Luma Can Do
- ✅ Create events with custom branding
- ✅ Email invitations to guest list
- ✅ Automatic reminders (24hr, 1hr before)
- ✅ RSVP tracking with attendee count
- ✅ Zoom integration (auto-generate meeting link)
- ✅ Post-event email with recording
- ✅ Waitlist functionality (creates urgency)
- ✅ Custom questions on registration form

### What Luma Can't Do (We Handle)
- ❌ SMS reminders → Ringy handles this
- ❌ Social proof posting → Manual or Buffer/social scheduling tool
- ❌ Phone call follow-ups → Gary + agent
- ❌ Shopping the application → Gary personally
- ❌ Facebook friend list scraping → Manual or agent provides list

### Luma API Capabilities
- **REST API** available for event creation, guest management
- Can programmatically: create events, add guests, send invitations
- Webhook support for RSVP notifications
- **Potential automation**: Donna creates event via API when new ICA is processed

## Automation Architecture

```
New Agent Signs ICA
        ↓
Donna receives notification (Ringy webhook or manual trigger)
        ↓
    ┌───────────────────────────┐
    │  1. Create Luma Event     │ (API)
    │  2. Set up Zoom meeting   │ (API)  
    │  3. Import guest list     │ (Luma API)
    │  4. Start SMS sequence    │ (Ringy drip)
    │  5. Create social assets  │ (templates)
    └───────────────────────────┘
        ↓
    Event Day: Me-Lin manages Zoom
    Gary presents + closes
        ↓
    Post-Event: Auto follow-up sequences fire
        ↓
    Converts → Onboarding (Agent Activation OS)
    Non-converts → Nurture sequence → Next Grand Opening invite
```

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Dajuan Benchmark |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Invites sent | 50-100 per event | 100 |
| RSVPs | 40-60% of invites | 50% |
| Show-up rate | 50% of RSVPs | 50% |
| Stay to end | 80% of attendees | — |
| Same-night converts | 30% of attendees | 40% |
| 72-hour converts | 50% of attendees | — |
| No-show recovery | 10% eventually convert | — |

**Dajuan's funnel**: 100 invites → 50 confirm → 25 show → 10 sign up (10% overall)
**Florio's funnel**: 10 invites → 6 confirm → 3 show → 1 signs (10% overall)

**Gary's target**: 50 invites → 25 RSVP → 12 show → 4-6 sign up (8-12% overall)

## Templates Needed

1. **Luma event page template** — branded, professional, with testimonials
2. **SMS invitation sequence** — 7-message drip (above)
3. **Social proof graphics** — "X people registered" countdown templates
4. **Zoom presentation deck** — welcome slide, Gary's story, iDecide, close
5. **Post-event follow-up sequence** — email + SMS (above)
6. **No-show recovery sequence** — SMS + recording link
7. **Agent prep checklist** — what agent needs to do before their grand opening

---

## MVP (Minimum Viable Grand Opening)

For the FIRST grand opening, simplify:

1. **Agent provides** 25 contacts (name + phone)
2. **Donna creates** Luma event + imports contacts
3. **Gary sends** 3 SMS manually via Ringy (Day 0, Day 5, Day 7)
4. **Me-Lin** sets up Zoom with welcome screen + music
5. **Gary presents** (30 min) using iDecide
6. **Donna sends** post-event follow-up SMS

**Total automation needed for MVP**: Luma event creation + 3 Ringy SMS templates

Then iterate from there.
