## Key Metrics Definitions

### Leading Indicators (you control these)
- **Leads imported:** New contacts from PropHog into Ringy
- **SMS sent:** Personal texts (not automated drip)
- **Calls made:** Outbound dials
- **Conversations:** 2+ message exchanges
- **Interviews scheduled:** Zoom calls booked

### Lagging Indicators (results of leading activity)
- **ICAs signed:** New agent agreements
- **Agents activated:** First policy written
- **Revenue:** Commission + overrides + renewals
- **Stick rate:** % of agents still active after 90 days

### The Only Formula That Matters
```
Leads × Response Rate × Call Rate × Close Rate = ICAs

Example (current estimated):
100 leads × 5% response × 50% call × 30% close = 0.75 ICAs/week

Example (with SMS fix):
100 leads × 20% response × 50% call × 40% close = 4 ICAs/week
```

Improving SMS response rate from 5% to 20% = **5x more ICAs** with the same lead volume.

## Sunday Night Ritual (15 min)

Every Sunday at 9 PM:

1. **Score the week** — Fill out the weekly scorecard honestly
2. **Identify the bottleneck** — What's the ONE thing limiting growth right now?
3. **Set the focus** — Pick ONE metric to improve next week
4. **Plan Monday** — What are the first 3 actions Monday morning?
5. **Update pipeline** — Move agents to correct stages in the tracker

### The Rules
- If you missed your targets, don't rationalize. Ask "what would I do differently?"
- If you hit your targets, raise them. Comfort is the enemy.
- Track trends, not days. One bad day is noise. One bad week is a signal.
- Never go two weeks without reviewing numbers. That's where slumps start.
