# 🎯 Grab Their Top 10 — Upline Calling Script
### How Gary Calls a New Agent's Best Contacts
*From Building an Empire, Chapter: "Grab Their Top 10"*

---

## The Principle

When a new agent joins, they're nervous and unskilled on the phone. Their best prospects will get a mediocre pitch and say no. So YOU call their top 10 — the sharpest, most ambitious contacts on their list.

> "Would you rather talk to a new recruit's top 10 sharpest prospects whom they can vouch for, or talk to 10 complete strangers you have no way of knowing if they possess any good qualities?" — Papa Kapp

## Step 1: Get the List (Day 1-2 of Onboarding)

**Say to new agent:**

> "[Agent], I need you to do something important. I want you to write down the names of the 10 sharpest, most ambitious people you know. These are people who are entrepreneurial, driven, successful — or hungry to be. Don't worry about whether they'd be interested. Just give me the 10 people you respect most for their hustle."

**If they resist:**

> "Look, I'm not going to hard-sell your friends. I'm going to have a professional conversation and see if they're open. You're new at this — let me handle the cream of the crop while you practice with the rest of your list. We're a team."

## Step 2: Agent Sends the Warm-Up Text

**Before Gary calls, the agent sends THIS text to each of the 10:**

> "Hi [Name], a gentleman named Gary Cosby is going to call you today about something very important and private. Be sure to take his call for a few minutes. We'll talk later."

That's it. Short. Mysterious. Creates anticipation.

## Step 3: Gary's Call Script

**The call (keep it under 3 minutes):**

> "Hey [Name], this is Gary Cosby. [Agent Name] referred me to you — and I have to tell you, they speak very highly of you. Said you're one of the sharpest people they know.
>
> Listen, I won't take much of your time. Real quick — [Agent] just partnered with me in a financial services business. We're a half-billion-dollar company, A-plus rated with the Better Business Bureau, and we're growing fast in [their area].
>
> [Agent] thought this might be right up your alley since you've got that entrepreneurial mindset. Here's what I'd love to do — I've got a short 10-minute presentation that explains exactly what we're doing. If you're open at all, take a look. If it's not for you, I'll never bring it up again. Fair enough?
>
> Do you have a pen? Great — go to [iDecide link / Calendly link]. Watch the presentation, and if you're interested, I'd love to hear from you. My direct number is [number].
>
> Thanks [Name]. [Agent] is lucky to have you in their corner."

## Step 4: Follow-Up Sequence

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| +24 hours | Text: "Hey [Name], did you get a chance to check out the presentation [Agent] wanted you to see?" |
| +48 hours | Call: "Hey [Name], it's Gary. Just following up on [Agent]'s behalf. Any thoughts?" |
| +72 hours | Text: "[Agent] is getting some great traction already. Wanted to make sure you didn't miss the window." |
| +7 days | Final: "Hey [Name], just circling back one last time. If you're interested, I'd love to chat. If not, no hard feelings at all." |

## Key Rules

1. **Always edify the agent**: "They speak so highly of you" — makes the agent look good
2. **Be brief**: 2-3 minutes max. Don't explain the business on the phone.
3. **Third-party presentation**: direct them to iDecide or Calendly, not a verbal pitch
4. **Keep the agent informed**: text the agent after each call with results
5. **Never hard-sell**: posture of "I'm offering you a look, not begging you to join"
