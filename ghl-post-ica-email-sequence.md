# Post-ICA Email Drip Sequence — GHL Workflow Spec

*Trigger: Contact tagged `ica-signed`*
*Duration: 7 days, 7 emails*
*Goal: Keep new agent engaged, build identity, prevent ghosting*

---

## Email 1: Immediately After ICA
**Subject:** Welcome to the team — here's what happens next
**Delay:** 0 (immediate on tag)

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

You just did something most people only talk about. You made a decision. That already puts you ahead.

Here's exactly what happens next:

📋 TODAY:
→ You'll get a text from me with your next step (CE scheduling)
→ Save my number: (321) 386-6527
→ Read the "Expect the Pushback" email (separate email, check your inbox)

📅 THIS WEEK:
→ Complete CE Part 1 (I'll book it with you on our call)
→ Meet your mentor (they'll reach out in the next 24 hours)
→ Join the team group chat

🎯 YOUR 14-DAY GOAL:
→ Earn your first check

Not "learn everything." Not "feel ready." Your goal is to GET PAID within 14 days. We'll show you how.

Talk soon,
Gary Cosby

## Email 2: Day 1 (Morning After)
**Subject:** The thing nobody tells new agents
**Delay:** 1 day

```
{{contact.first_name}},

Here's the thing nobody in this industry tells you on Day 1:

You don't need to know everything to start making money.

Seriously. The agents who struggle aren't the ones who know less. They're the ones who wait until they feel "ready." Spoiler: you never feel ready. You just start.

Your first appointment won't be perfect. Mine wasn't. Nobody's is. But it will be REAL. And that's when this shifts from "something I'm trying" to "something I'm building."

Quick homework for today:
→ Write down your WHY. Not "money." What specifically changes when this works?
→ Think of 5 people you'd feel comfortable having a conversation with
→ That's it. Five names. We'll talk about what to say to them later.

You've got this.

— Gary

## Email 3: Day 3
**Subject:** Everyone's going to have an opinion
**Delay:** 3 days

```
{{contact.first_name}},

By now, you might have told someone about your new career.

And they might have said something that stung.

"Is that a pyramid scheme?"
"Be careful..."
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."

Here's what I want you to know: that reaction is NORMAL. Every single person on our team heard it. I heard it. The people making $20K/month heard it.

Those people aren't being mean. They're reacting to what they don't understand. They've never sat across from a family and helped them protect their future. They've never seen a commission check for work that actually matters.

You have something they don't: you said yes. You took action. That takes courage.

Don't let someone who's never done what you're doing tell you it can't be done.

Keep going.

— Gary

P.S. If you haven't connected with your mentor yet, do it today. They've been exactly where you are right now.

## Email 4: Day 5
**Subject:** The 4 Buckets (this will change how you see money)
**Delay:** 5 days

```
{{contact.first_name}},

Quick lesson that'll change how you talk to every client you ever meet.

There are only 4 places your money can go:

🪣 Bucket 1: Banks (savings, checking, CDs)
→ "Safe" but barely grows. Inflation eats it alive.

🪣 Bucket 2: Stock Market (401K, IRA, brokerage)
→ Can grow big, but you can lose big too. And Uncle Sam takes his cut.

🪣 Bucket 3: Real Estate
→ Great wealth builder, but not liquid. You can't sell a bedroom when you need cash.

🪣 Bucket 4: Life Insurance (IUL)
→ This is where it gets interesting. Tax-free growth. Downside protection. Living benefits. Access to your money. And a death benefit that protects your family.

Most people have all their money in Buckets 1-3 and have never even heard of Bucket 4. That's the gap we fill. That's why this matters.

When you sit across from a client and explain these four buckets, you're not "selling insurance." You're opening their eyes to something their bank and their 401K provider will never tell them.

That's powerful. And that's your job now.

— Gary

## Email 5: Day 7 (One Week)
**Subject:** One week in. Let's check in.
**Delay:** 7 days

```
{{contact.first_name}},

It's been a week. Let's be real for a second.

How are you feeling? Scale of 1-10?

If you're at a 7-10: Amazing. You're in the zone. Keep that momentum.

If you're at a 4-6: Normal. Totally normal. This is the "I know I made the right decision but I'm not sure what I'm doing yet" phase. It passes. Lean into the training. Call your mentor.

If you're at 1-3: Call me. Not tomorrow. Today. Seriously. (321) 386-6527.

Here's what you should have done by now:
✅ CE Part 1 complete (or scheduled)
✅ Connected with your mentor
✅ Joined the team chat
✅ Written down 5 people you could talk to

If you've done all four — you're on track. If you haven't — that's okay, but let's get caught up this week.

The agents who make it aren't the smartest or most talented. They're the ones who keep showing up.

Keep showing up.

— Gary
```

## Email 6: Day 10
**Subject:** Your first appointment (let's make it happen)
**Delay:** 10 days

```
{{contact.first_name}},

Here's the secret nobody talks about:

Your first appointment doesn't need to go well. It just needs to HAPPEN.

I'm serious. The gap between "I've been trained" and "I've actually sat with a real person" is where 85% of agents get stuck. They keep studying. They keep watching videos. They keep "preparing." And they never actually DO it.

Here's how we close that gap:

1. Pick one person from your list of 5
2. Send them this text: "Hey [name], I just started working with a financial services firm and I'm learning how to help families with retirement planning and life insurance. Would you be open to being my first practice client? I just need 20 minutes and your honest feedback."
3. Book the meeting
4. A senior agent will be there with you (3-way) to do the heavy lifting

That's it. One text. One meeting. Everything changes after that.

Will you send that text today?

— Gary
```

## Email 7: Day 14 (Two Weeks)
**Subject:** 14 days ago you made a decision
**Delay:** 14 days

```
{{contact.first_name}},

Two weeks ago, you decided to change your life.

Think about that for a second. Two weeks ago, this was just an idea. Now you're licensed (or almost), you're trained (or training), and you're part of a team that has your back.

If you've already had your first appointment or earned your first check — CONGRATULATIONS. You're in the top 15% of agents in this industry. Seriously. Most people don't make it this far.

If you haven't yet — we're not done. Not even close. Your window isn't closing. But I need you to take ONE action today:

→ If you haven't had an appointment: Send that text to someone on your list
→ If you haven't finished CE: Book it this week
→ If you're feeling stuck: Call your mentor or call me

The next 2 weeks are where the magic happens. The people who push through this phase are the ones sitting on stage at our next event.

I believe in you. Now it's your turn to believe in yourself.

Mission before commission,
Gary Cosby
