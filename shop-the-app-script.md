# 🛒 Shop the Application — Chain Recruiting Script
### Turn 1 ICA Into 5+ in the Same Day
*Based on Brian Carruthers' technique from Building an Empire*

---

## The Concept

You just signed Agent X. BEFORE you process their ICA, use their application as leverage to close every fence-sitter on your list.

Brian Carruthers recruited **9 people in one day** using this technique. Gary has never done it. This is the unlock.

## The Script

### Call 1: Right After Agent X Signs ICA

**You** (calling a prospect who's been on the fence):

> "Hey Beth, it's Gary. Quick call — I've got some exciting news and honestly I wanted to give you first shot at this.
>
> Remember we talked about the financial services opportunity? Well, I just signed up James — really sharp guy, former [profession], super motivated. He's already fired up about the people he's going to bring in.
>
> Here's the thing — I'm about to submit James's application into the system. But before I do, I wanted to give YOU a chance to get in ahead of him.
>
> If you submit your application right now, James goes UNDER you on your team. That means every person James recruits, every sale he makes — you earn override income on all of it. Forever.
>
> I figured since you've been thinking about this, why not let me put a sharp producer on your team before he even starts? That's a pretty good deal.
>
> Are you by your computer? Let's get your ICA done in the next 10 minutes so I can place James under you."

### When Beth Signs Up — Call the Next Person

> "Hey Mike, it's Gary. Man, things are moving fast over here.
>
> I just signed up TWO people in the last hour — Beth and James. Both really motivated, already making their lists.
>
> I'm about to submit their applications, but I wanted to call you first. If you get your application in before I process theirs, BOTH of them go under you.
>
> That's two producers on your team before you even make your first call. The override income alone could cover your $199 investment in the first month.
>
> Look, I know you've been on the fence. But these opportunities don't wait. Once I submit their apps, they're placed — and whoever gets in next goes below whoever I just submitted.
>
> Can you pull up the ICA right now?"

### The Chain Continues

Each new signup gives you MORE ammunition:

> "Hey [Name], I've signed up THREE people today. All sharp. All motivated. I've got one more spot above them — whoever gets in next gets all three on their team. You in?"

## Key Principles

1. **NEVER process the first application immediately.** Hold it. Shop it first.
2. **Call your WARMEST prospects first** — the ones who almost said yes before
3. **Create genuine urgency** — this is real, not fake. Those people ARE joining.
4. **Stack the value** — with each new signup, the offer gets MORE compelling
5. **Speed matters** — do this within 2-3 hours. Don't let a day pass.
6. **Use this as LAST RESORT for fence-sitters** — don't lead with this for new prospects

## Who to Call (In Order)

1. Prospects who saw the iDecide presentation but didn't sign
2. Prospects who said "let me think about it"
3. Prospects who said "I can't afford $199 right now"
4. Ghost leads who went silent after positive initial contact
5. Agents in Ringy marked "Warm" who haven't converted

## After the Chain

- Process ALL applications in order (first signer at top, last at bottom)
- This creates a natural depth structure — exactly what Papa Kapp teaches
- Each person has team members below them on Day 1
- Welcome calls for ALL new agents within 24 hours
- Expect the Pushback document to each one
- Book PBR/iDecide within 5 days for each

## Ringy Integration

After shopping the app:
1. Update each contact's status in Ringy to "ICA'd"
2. Add notes: "Signed [date] via chain recruit from [Agent X]'s app"
3. Start onboarding SMS sequence for each
4. Schedule welcome calls

## Gary's Adaptation

Gary's fence-sitters (from Ringy Warm list, ~12 agents):
- These are people who've already SEEN the opportunity
- They're waiting for a reason to act
- "I just signed someone sharp and they're going under whoever gets in next" IS that reason

**First time to try this**: Next time Gary ICAs a new agent, immediately call the 3-5 warmest prospects from the roster. Even getting 1 more = 100% improvement.
