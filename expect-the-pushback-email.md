Hey [FIRST NAME],

Welcome to the team. I'm fired up you made this decision. But before we jump into training, I need to prepare you for something that's coming — because it's coming for EVERY new agent, and the ones who know it's coming are the ones who survive it.

**The Pushback.**

### Here's What's About to Happen

You're going to tell someone you trust — a friend, a family member, maybe your spouse — that you just started a career in financial services. And they're going to look at you like you lost your mind.

Some will say it nicely: *"Just be careful..."*

Some won't be nice at all: *"Is that one of those pyramid things?"*

Your cousin might laugh. Your best friend might go quiet. Someone you respect might try to talk you out of it.

**This is not a sign you made a bad decision. This is a sign you made a BRAVE one.**

Every single person on our team who's making real money went through this exact moment. I went through it. The people earning $20K, $30K, $50K a month went through it. It's the toll booth on the highway to financial freedom — you have to pass through it.

### Why People React This Way

They're not rejecting you. They're reacting to what they don't understand.

- They've never seen what you're about to see
- They've heard one negative story and made it their whole opinion
- They're uncomfortable that you're doing something they're too scared to try
- They're projecting their own fear of failure onto YOUR decision

**Would you let someone who's never been to a restaurant review the food?** That's what's happening when people judge your business without ever seeing the presentation.

### What the Numbers Actually Look Like

This is a numbers game — just like real estate, car sales, or any profession where income isn't capped:

- Out of every 10 people you talk to → 2-3 will look at the opportunity
- Out of those who look → 3-5 will join
- Out of those who join → 1-2 will actually build

The math is simple: **talk to more people, make more money.** The people who succeed aren't special — they just didn't stop when someone told them no.

### Your Homework Before We Meet Again

I need you to do ONE thing before our next session:

**🎧 Listen to "Building an Empire" by Brian Carruthers**

This audiobook will change how you think about what we're building. It's the playbook for this industry — recruiting, leadership, duplication, all of it. You don't have to finish it (it's about 7 hours), but I need you to START it.

**👉 [Listen here — Building an Empire (audiobook)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZsPw1zyX104g9w7RINqBMSYHxhnhIAxW/view?usp=sharing)**

Listen on your commute, at the gym, while you're cooking — wherever. The agents who do this homework come into our next meeting 10x more prepared.

### Book Your First Training Session (CE Part 1)

This is where we get into the actual business — how you'll make money, how you'll serve clients, and how you'll build your team. It's a live Zoom call with me, usually 60-90 minutes.

**👉 [Book CE Part 1 here](https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/bookings/gary-cosby-jr-personal-calendar-kd5a-po0d)**

Book it within the next 48 hours. Momentum matters more than anything right now.

### What You Can Expect From Me

- I answer my phone
- I'll help you close your prospects personally
- I'll celebrate every win, no matter how small
- I'll be honest — even when it's uncomfortable
- I'll never ask you to do something I'm not willing to do myself

My father died of pancreatic cancer without life insurance. His ending could've been different. The person I was two years ago — broke, fired after 23 years, $100K in debt — needed someone to show him the way. Nobody did.

I'm not going to let that happen to you.

You made a decision. Now let's make it count.

— Gary

*"Some will, some won't, so what? Next."*

*Save this email. Read it again when you get your first no. And your tenth. Then call me.*
