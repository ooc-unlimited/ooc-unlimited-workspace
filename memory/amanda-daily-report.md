## Social Media Branding Trends (Last 30 Days Research)

### What's Working Right Now

**1. Short-Form Video Dominates Everything**
- 15-60 second videos outperform static posts across all platforms
- Hook in first 3 seconds is non-negotiable — bold stat or provocative question
- One concept per video — don't try to explain everything
- Trending audio + text overlays = algorithm boost on TikTok/Reels

**2. Faceless Branding is Mainstream**
- Animated explainers with voiceover only (no face on camera needed)
- Stock footage + bold text overlays for recruiting content
- Canva, CapCut AI, and AI avatar tools making this accessible to solo agents
- Carousel-to-video conversion (infographic → scrolling Reel) drives saves/shares

**3. AI Content Automation is Standard**
- AI scripting 10+ hook variations, picking winners via analytics
- CapCut AI for auto-edits, ChatGPT/Claude for scripting
- AI chatbots in link-in-bio funneling DMs to applications
- 40% of content tasks now automatable

**4. "Day in the Life" Recruiting Content**
- "Day in the life of a 6-figure insurance agent" format getting massive reach
- Fast cuts, trending audio, text overlays showing income/lifestyle
- Works faceless (screen recordings, stock footage, testimonials)

**5. Educational-First, Sell-Second**
- Teaching beats pitching — "Here's why minimum auto insurance could bankrupt you" outperforms "Buy insurance from me"
- Educational content builds trust AND recruits (agents see you as an authority)
