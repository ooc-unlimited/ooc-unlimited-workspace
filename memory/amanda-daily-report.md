## 🔍 Last 30 Days Trend Research

### What's Working in Insurance/Financial Services Content
- **Gen Z/Millennial-targeted educational content** is leading engagement — life insurers like State Farm and Haven Life are extending campaigns to TikTok with creator partnerships
- **Finfluencer-style posts** teaching retirement basics, legacy planning, and income protection via quizzes and downloadable guides
- TikTok engagement leads all platforms at **0.98%** for financial services content
- **Content funnel format**: Quiz → Educational tip → CTA link is converting highest quality leads
- **Insurtechs partnering with TikTok creators** who link directly to applications — blending education with action

### Faceless Content Trends
- **Faceless is dominating** for compliance and scalability — text overlays, animations, AI voiceovers
- Educational carousels and Reels showing "protection solutions" via infographics and stats (no face needed)
- TikTok duets/stitches reacting to user queries using screen recordings of tools
- Day-in-life animation series building trust post-by-post

### AI-Generated Content Trends
- **GenAI personalization exploding** — advisors using AI for tailored funnels, personalized quotes, drip content
- AI agents autonomously creating email sequences, quizzes, and short videos
- ElevenLabs voice cloning + HeyGen avatars = the standard stack for faceless creators at scale
- Compliance-first AI content (human-overseen) is the sweet spot

### Short-Form Video Hooks That Are Working
1. **Question hooks**: "Saving for retirement at 25? Here's why life insurance fits"
2. **Stat shocks**: "86% of Gen Z use apps for bills — but 70% have zero life insurance"
3. **Scenario starters**: "You just got laid off. Here's the ONE thing you need to protect first"
4. **Contrast hooks**: "I went from $100K in debt to $12K checks. Here's the industry no one talks about"
5. **Pattern interrupt**: Start mid-story, no intro, raw and real

### Viral Formats
| Format | Why It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| Content Funnel Reel (Quiz → Tip → CTA) | High lead quality, nurtures to consultation |
| Creator Partnership Duet/Stitch | Trusted endorsements, direct conversions |
| AI-Personalized Carousel (Problem → Stat → Solution) | Compliance-safe, builds funnels |
| Humanizing Story Series (faceless animations) | Builds trust without on-camera time |
| Before/After Transformation | Income journey = aspirational + proof |
