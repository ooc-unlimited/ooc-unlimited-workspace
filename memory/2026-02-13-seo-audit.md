# SEO Audit — garylifeindex.com
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Site:** https://garylifeindex.com  
**Codebase:** /Users/donna/.openclaw/workspace/onboarding-system/ (Next.js 14, port 3001)

## Summary

Ran a full SEO audit and fixed all major issues. The site was missing robots.txt, sitemap, Open Graph/Twitter tags, structured data, canonical URLs, and had generic meta titles. All fixed. Build compiles clean.

---

## 1. Meta Titles & Descriptions

| Page | Before | After | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Root layout | "Onboarding Command Center" / generic | "GFI × Team OOC \| Financial Services Career Opportunity" + keyword-rich description | ✅ Fixed |
| /join | "GFI x Team OOC — Career Opportunity" | "Join GFI × Team OOC — Build Your Financial Services Career" + expanded description | ✅ Fixed |
| /login | None (inherited root) | "Login — Onboarding Command Center" + noindex | ✅ Fixed |
| /carriers | None | "Carrier Product Guide" + noindex | ✅ Fixed |
| /grand-opening | None | "Grand Opening Factory" + noindex | ✅ Fixed |
| Dashboard (/) | None | Inherits root title template | ✅ OK |

**Note:** Dashboard pages (/login, /carriers, /grand-opening, /agents, /alerts, /metrics) are behind auth middleware — set to `noindex, nofollow` to keep them out of search.

---

## 2. robots.txt

**Before:** Did not exist  
**After:** Created at `public/robots.txt`
- Allows `/join` (the public-facing page)
- Blocks `/api/`, `/login`, `/agents`, `/carriers`, `/alerts`, `/metrics`, `/grand-opening`, `/email-preview`, `/sms-templates`
- Points to sitemap at `https://garylifeindex.com/sitemap.xml`

✅ Fixed

---

## 3. XML Sitemap

**Before:** Did not exist  
**After:** Created `src/app/sitemap.ts` (Next.js dynamic sitemap)
- Generates `/sitemap.xml` automatically at build time
- Includes: root (`/`) priority 0.5, `/join` priority 1.0
- Dashboard pages excluded (behind auth)
- Verified in build output: `○ /sitemap.xml`

✅ Fixed

---

## 4. Open Graph & Twitter Cards

**Before:** None on any page  
**After:**
- **Root layout:** Full OG (type, locale, url, siteName, title, description, image) + Twitter card (summary_large_image)
- **Join page:** Full OG + Twitter with `/join` canonical URL
- **Dashboard pages:** Not needed (noindex)
- **OG image:** Uses `/images/nyse-signing.jpeg` (NYSE signing ceremony — strong visual)

✅ Fixed

---

## 5. Canonical URLs

**Before:** None  
**After:**
- Root layout: `metadataBase` set to `https://garylifeindex.com` (Next.js uses this for all relative URLs)
- Root: canonical → `https://garylifeindex.com`
- /join: canonical → `https://garylifeindex.com/join`

✅ Fixed

---

## 6. Schema / Structured Data

**Before:** None  
**After:** Added JSON-LD in root layout `<head>`:
- **Organization** schema: name, url, logo, description, founder (Gary Cosby Jr.), foundingDate, contactPoint
- **WebSite** schema: name, url, description

✅ Fixed

---

## 7. Alt Text on Images

| Image | Alt Text | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| NYSE signing photo (`/join`) | "Partnership Signing Ceremony at NYSE" | ✅ Already good |
| Culture video thumbnails (`/join`) | Each has `alt={v.title}` (e.g., "Partnership Ownership Program", "Five F's") | ✅ Already good |
| No other `<img>` tags found | — | ✅ OK |

---

## 8. Heading Hierarchy

**/join page analysis:**
- `<h1>` — "Opportunity Overview" (hero) — ✅ Single H1
- `<h2>` — "GFI × Team OOC Career", "Why GFI & Team OOC?", "Three Pillars of Impact", "12 Reasons Why", "Trusted Partnership Network", "GFI's Specialized Divisions", "How We Help Our Clients", "Six Ways You Can Get Paid", "Where Do You See Yourself Starting?", "Frequently Asked Questions", "Ready to Begin?", "Culture Makes the Difference" — ✅ Proper H2 sections
- `<h3>` — Sub-sections within H2s — ✅ Proper nesting
- `<h4>` — Card titles within sections — ✅ Proper nesting

**Dashboard pages:** H1 on each page (Pipeline Dashboard, Carrier Product Guide, Grand Opening Factory, Login) — ✅ OK

✅ Good — no hierarchy issues

---

## 9. Internal Linking

**Current state:**
- `/join` is the public landing page — standalone, no nav links to other pages (by design — it's a focused landing page for recruits)
- Dashboard has full sidebar navigation between internal pages
- No cross-linking from join → dashboard (correct — dashboard is auth-gated)

**Recommendation (future):**
- Consider adding a simple header/footer on `/join` with links to privacy policy, terms, etc. when those pages exist
- If a public blog or resources section is added, link from `/join`

✅ OK for current scope (single public page)

---

## 10. Performance Basics

| Check | Finding | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Images | Only 1 image (`nyse-signing.jpeg`) — loaded eagerly (above fold in POP section). Video thumbs use `loading="lazy"` ✅ | ✅ Good |
| Fonts | Google Fonts (Inter) via `next/font` — auto-optimized, self-hosted | ✅ Good |
| JS bundle | /join: 16.2 kB page + 87.3 kB shared = ~104 kB first load | ✅ Reasonable |
| Videos | Embedded via iframes (Adilo) — loaded on-demand (culture videos only when clicked) | ✅ Good |
| CSS | Tailwind + minimal inline styles | ✅ Good |
| `next/image` | Not used — the NYSE image uses raw `<img>`. Could switch to `next/image` for automatic WebP/AVIF, srcset, lazy loading | ⚠️ Minor improvement possible |

**Recommendation:** Convert `<img src="/images/nyse-signing.jpeg">` to `next/image` for automatic optimization. Low priority — it's a single image.

## Build Verification

```
✅ next build — completed successfully
✅ /sitemap.xml — generates correctly
✅ All pages compile without errors
```

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/app/layout.tsx` | Full metadata overhaul: title template, description, keywords, OG, Twitter, robots, canonical, JSON-LD schema |
| `src/app/join/layout.tsx` | Added OG, Twitter, canonical for /join |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/login/layout.tsx` | Created — meta title + noindex |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/carriers/layout.tsx` | Created — meta title + noindex |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/grand-opening/layout.tsx` | Created — meta title + noindex |
| `public/robots.txt` | Created — allow /join, block dashboard/API |
| `src/app/sitemap.ts` | Created — dynamic XML sitemap |

---

## Remaining Recommendations (Future)

1. **OG image optimization** — Create a dedicated 1200×630 OG image with GFI branding instead of reusing the NYSE photo
2. **`next/image`** — Convert the NYSE `<img>` tag to `next/image` for WebP/AVIF auto-conversion
3. **Favicon/app icon** — Currently using default Next.js favicon. Create branded favicon + apple-touch-icon
4. **Privacy policy / Terms pages** — Needed for compliance and footer links
5. **Google Search Console** — Submit sitemap after deploying
6. **Analytics** — Add Google Analytics or Plausible for traffic tracking
