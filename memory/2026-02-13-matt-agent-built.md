# Matt Agent Built — Feb 13, 2026

## What Happened
Transcribed a 3h49m GFI MD & SMD Academy video (Jan 10, 2026) featuring Matthew Welsh (Field Chairman), Tavares Dove, Marty Schaefer (President), Eric Olson (CEO), and other speakers. Also incorporated an existing matt-welsh.md transcript from an in-person event.

## Transcription Process
- Video split into 8 x ~30min WAV chunks
- Transcribed using mlx_whisper (whisper-large-v3-turbo) on Mac mini
- Each chunk took ~3-5 minutes to transcribe
- Some Whisper hallucination artifacts (repetitive phrases during music/silence) — expected
