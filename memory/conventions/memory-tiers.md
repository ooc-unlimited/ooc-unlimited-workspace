# Memory Tiers System

## Tier 1: Hot Memory (Always Loaded)
- **AGENTS.md** (budget: ≤1800 bytes) - Core identity, rules, workflows
- **MEMORY.md** (budget: ≤2000 bytes) - Critical facts, current priorities

## Tier 2: Warm Memory (Queryable)
- **memory/core-patterns.md** - Behavioral patterns, lessons learned
- **memory/gary-context.md** - Deep background, family, motivations
- **memory/business-context.md** - Industry knowledge, systems, processes
- **memory/auto-learned.md** - Patterns discovered by dream cycles

## Tier 3: Cold Memory (Searchable via QMD)
- **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** - Daily logs, raw events
- **memory/*.md** - Project logs, specific incidents

## Dream Cycle Rules:
1. Never delete information - only move to appropriate tier
2. Preserve SOUL.md personality - never optimize it away
3. Create drafts before applying Tier 1 changes
4. Update auto-learned.md with new patterns
5. Keep Tier 1 files focused on what's actively needed
