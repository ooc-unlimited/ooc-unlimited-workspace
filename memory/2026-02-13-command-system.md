# 2026-02-13 — Command System Setup

## What Was Created

### Command System (`.claude/commands/`)
Formalized reusable command files inspired by Claude Code workspace templates:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/create-plan <task>` | Generate a detailed implementation plan → saved to `plans/` |
| `/implement <plan-file>` | Execute every step in a plan, update docs, mark complete |
| `/analyze-competitor <name>` | Research a competing agency/recruiter → saved to `outputs/` |
| `/market-scan [focus]` | Scan insurance recruiting landscape for trends → `outputs/` |
| `/recruit-research <name> [state]` | Deep research on a licensed agent prospect → `outputs/` |

### Directory Structure
- `plans/` — Implementation plans generated by `/create-plan`
- `outputs/` — Reports, analyses, and research generated by commands
- `.claude/commands/` — Command definition files (markdown prompts)

### How It Works
- Commands use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input
- `/create-plan` reads full workspace context before generating a plan
- `/implement` reads a plan file, executes steps, updates plan status to Complete
- Research commands save structured reports to `outputs/` for future reference

### Usage Examples
```
/create-plan Build an automated onboarding email sequence for new recruits
/implement plans/2026-02-13-onboarding-emails.md
/analyze-competitor Symmetry Financial Group
/market-scan AI tools in insurance recruiting
/recruit-research John Smith Florida
```
