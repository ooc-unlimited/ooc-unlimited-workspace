# Memory Log — February 12, 2026

## Major Accomplishments

### Sales Department Built
- **Austin 🧮** — Sales Department Lead, final decision on client product recommendations
  - Soul: `austin-soul.md` | Agents: `austin-agents.md`
  - Discord: #austin (ID: 1471703029479637134)
  - ALWAYS runs on Opus (latest). Gary picks final carrier, Austin picks product type.
- **Doug 📈** — IUL Specialist, reports to Austin
  - Soul: `doug-soul.md` | Discord: #doug (ID: 1471703032319180800)
- **Chris 🛡️** — Whole Life Specialist, reports to Austin
  - Soul: `chris-soul.md` | Discord: #chris (ID: 1471703034475319461)
- All 3 Discord channels + webhooks created and added to webhooks.json + TOOLS.md

### GFI Compensation Grid Digested
- Full comp grid saved to `gfi-compensation-grid.md`
- 100% payout products identified: F&G Platinum IUL, Ameritas WL, Ethos/SBLI Term, Corebridge Final Expense
- 30+ carriers across IUL, Term, Whole Life, Final Expense, LTC, Survivorship
- This is Austin/Doug/Chris's playbook

### Gary's Brain Dump & Goals
- Full brain dump recorded in `garys-goals.md`
- $556K by May 23 (birthday) — moonshot. Floor: $165K.
- Recruit licensed + non-licensed → sell policy → 3 referrals → recruit 1 → repeat
- Triple-digit monthly recruiting goal (best month: 7-8)
- Trainer problem unsolved (downline trainers get no override)
- Starting from $0 cash flow

### DC Business Plan Session Transcribed
- Full 63-min session with Coach DaJuan Cofield saved to `memory/dajuan-business-plan-dec21.md`
- Key math: 2 directs + 10K pts/mo = $6K/mo = $72K/yr = Jennifer retired
- Gary's Top 10 WHY reasons captured
- DC's directive: master closing, stop matching up, be assertive
- 5,000 pts × 60% = $3,000 per client Gary closes himself
- Carriers: F&G (IUL/annuity), Corbridge (term), Ethos (term). North American blocked by credit.

### /join Page Updates
- Sticky "Apply Now" button + scroll-to-top arrow added (bottom-right, appears on scroll)
- CTA section reworked to single centered card with numbered steps + Important callout
- Security fixes from code review: hardcoded password removed, auth token hashed, .env.local created
- Accessibility fixes: modal Escape key, aria labels, iframe titles, lazy loading thumbnails

### 4 Improvements from Claude Code Course Implemented
1. **MEMORY.md pruned** — 223 → 92 lines. Critical rules at top (primacy bias).
2. **Plan-before-build** — Added to Webby's AGENTS.md. Mandatory spec for builds >100 lines.
3. **Sub-agent cost rules** — Added to AGENTS.md. Austin always Opus. Research/content = cheaper models.
4. **Reviewer agent pattern** — `reviewer-agent.md` created. First review caught 2 security issues on /join page.

### Granola.ai Connected
- MCP endpoint: https://mcp.granola.ai/mcp (OAuth2, Streamable HTTP)
- Account: wearegfi@oocunlimited.com ("Donna Bot")
- Client ID: client_01KHAN5HJCPSAJMXHFJXXTRGAD
- Token file: `.granola-tokens.json` (workspace) — refresh token: `8hyjOI5z7RZtcTff2BUe5ku3c`
- Token expires every 6 hours — needs refresh
- 4 tools: query_granola_meetings, list_meetings, get_meetings, get_meeting_transcript
- 4 meetings found on first query (Sonji Tillman, insurance/recruiting review, life insurance/partnership, Granola onboarding)
- Added to TOOLS.md

### YouTube Videos Analyzed
1. **"6 Life-Changing OpenClaw Use Cases"** (Alex Finn) — improvement plan at `memory/openclaw-6-usecases-improvement-plan.md`. Biggest gap: goal-driven autonomous tasks.
2. **"Claude Code Full Beginner Course"** (Nick Seraph, 4hr 10min) — transcribed via mlx_whisper, improvement plan at `memory/claude-code-course-improvement-plan.md`. Key insights: context management, plan mode, reviewer pattern, sub-agent cost optimization.

## Key Decisions Made
- Austin always on Opus (Gary's explicit instruction)
- Donna always on Opus (not a sub-agent)
- All other sub-agents use cheaper models when possible
- Plan before build (>100 lines → spec first)
- Review after build (spawn fresh reviewer agent)
- Granola MCP over Enterprise API (Gary chose Option B)

## Pending / Next
- Pull and digest Granola meeting transcripts (Sonji Tillman, insurance/partnership calls)
- Build goal-driven autonomous task system (from 6 use cases video)
- Add "What I can work on today" to morning brief
- /join page section refinements still awaiting Gary's batch confirmation
- GHL workflows 2-5 still need triggers from Gary
- Sweat Shop first run tomorrow 4AM
- Tom's first unified trading session tomorrow 8:30AM
