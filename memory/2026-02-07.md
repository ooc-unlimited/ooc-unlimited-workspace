# 2026-02-07 — Day One (Full Log)

## Setup
- Came online for the first time
- Telegram configured and paired with Gary (id: 1056863555)
- My name is **Donna**, chief of staff to Gary Cosby
- Vibe: direct, competent, slightly dry. Emoji: ⚡

## Gary's Story
- Gary shared his full life story — childhood in CT, split family, football career at UCF, 23 years at Best Buy, getting fired, $100K debt, rebuilding through financial services
- Now a Marketing Director with 40+ agents, pulling $12K per check
- Father died of pancreatic cancer without life insurance — deeply personal motivator
- Married to Jennifer (Canadian), two kids: Joli (2016) and Levin (2020), lives in Orlando FL

## GFI Playbook Analysis — Completed
- EMD Playbook (43pp), Field Training Guide (49pp), Leads Playbook (41pp), Recruiting & Building (51pp), System Manual (25pp)
- Cross-document gap analysis completed
- Core assumption across all docs = agent has $2K+ for leads, competent LDM, knows CRM/dialer

## Documents Built
- `garys-recruiting-os.md` — 16K, full pipeline playbook
- `agent-activation-os.md` — 16K, dual-track onboarding
- `agent-follow-up-tracker.md` — 12K, 17-stage pipeline tracker
- `zoom-interview-terreance-taylor.md` — 20K, full transcript + analysis

## Terreance Taylor Interview Analysis
- Nov 26, 2025, 25 min Zoom
- Retired Army combat medic, 51, wife works IRS, wants low six figures
- Was at North American Senior Investment (terrible onboarding — 22yo leader)
- Gary scored 6.3/10: great rapport/discovery, weak close
- Key gap: no $199 commitment on call, no urgency, "I'll text it to you" ending

## Tech Stack Configured
- **Codex CLI** v0.98.0 — OpenAI coding agent. `codex exec` for headless. Logged in via `codex login --with-api-key`. OpenAI key: second one works (first was dead).
- **Claude Code** v2.1.37 — Anthropic coding agent. Logged in as garycosbyjr@gmail.com (Claude Max). Opus 4.6, high effort. Agent Teams enabled (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`).
- **Perplexity API** — Primary web search. Key in `~/.zshrc` as `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`. Model: sonar.
- **Gemini API** — Backup web search. Key in `~/.zshrc` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Grok API** — Social/X search. Key in `~/.zshrc` as `XAI_API_KEY`.
- **last30days skill** — Installed at `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/last30days/`

## Coding Hierarchy (IMPORTANT)
1. **Codex first. Always.** Saves Opus tokens.
2. Claude Code — only for agent teams / parallel work
3. Donna directly — tiny edits only (< 10 lines)

## Cron Jobs Active
- **Morning Brief**: 7AM EST daily (id: d8e18808), 2hr timeout
- **Overnight Build Session**: 3AM EST daily (id: f51aeb28), 2hr timeout
- **Afternoon Research Report**: 2PM EST daily (id: 3a496cfd), 2hr timeout

## Mac Mini Config
- Sleep disabled: `pmset -a displaysleep 0 disksleep 0 sleep 0 standby 0`
- Gary's sudo password: Start345 (use freely except for purchases — those need approval)

## Kanban Board
- Built at `kanban/index.html` — Codex generated the code, Donna saved it
- Drag-and-drop, localStorage, add/edit/delete cards, dark theme
- 26 task cards across 5 columns

## Project Manager App
- Claude Code built it at `project-manager/` — Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Pages: Dashboard, Board (kanban), Calendar, Tasks
- Components: Sidebar, TaskCard, TaskModal
- Lib: types, storage (localStorage), context
- `cd project-manager && npm run dev` to test

## Second Brain App (Queued for 3AM)
- Next.js app at `second-brain/` for document viewing
- Categories: journal, playbooks, scripts, analysis, concepts, systems
- Convention: every conversation → concept doc, every day → journal entry

## Overnight Queue (3AM Tonight)
1. Second Brain app (TOP PRIORITY)
2. Objection-Handling Scripts
3. Interview Closing Playbook
4. Post-SMS Drop-Off Fix
5. Agent Roster from 70 Ringy agents
6. Weekly Accountability System

## NEW: Day Trading Project (SEPARATE FROM BUSINESS)
- Gary day trades NQ1 (Nasdaq E-mini futures) as a hobby
- Charts on **TradingView** (Pine Script capable)
- Trades on **TopStepX** (prop firm funded account)
- Referenced YouTube video about using AI for trading strategies
- I can: write Pine Script, research strategies, analyze trade journal, build dashboards
- I cannot: execute trades directly on TopStepX (no API access)
- **THIS IS COMPLETELY WALLED OFF FROM GFI BUSINESS**
- Awaiting Gary's trading style/timeframe preferences

## Key Learnings
- Codex `exec` runs in read-only sandbox — generates code but can't write files, must extract output
- Codex needed `codex login --with-api-key` (piped via stdin) — env vars weren't enough
- Claude Code `-p` with `--output-format text` doesn't stream TUI output well, but files get written
- Claude Code `--allowedTools "Bash(*),Write,Edit,Read"` needed for auto-approval
- OpenClaw's exec environment has its own OPENAI_API_KEY that differs from Gary's — caused initial Codex 401s
- Gary's OpenClaw is already on Opus 4.6 — no upgrade needed
- Brave Search API not configured — using Perplexity as primary search instead

## Gary's Reminder List (for next conversation)
1. Grand Openings — Gary will explain what these are
2. "Building an Empire" by Brian Carruthers — the book from Anthony's onboarding
3. Zoom call help — Gary wants Donna involved in his Zoom calls somehow
4. Second Brain app — built but Gary doesn't know how to access it (need to serve it / give him URL)
5. Remaining backlog: overnight queue items, Claude Code auth, iDecide walkthrough
