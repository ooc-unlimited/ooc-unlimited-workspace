# Dream Log - Nightly Memory Cleanup

## 2026-02-20 02:00 AM - First Dream Cycle

### Files Over Budget
- **AGENTS.md**: 8752 bytes (budget: 1800) - OVER by 6952 bytes
- **MEMORY.md**: 6536 bytes (budget: 2000) - OVER by 4536 bytes

### Actions Taken
1. **Created memory tier system**: `memory/conventions/memory-tiers.md`
2. **Created Tier 2 files**:
   - `memory/core-patterns.md` - Behavioral patterns, group chat rules, heartbeat workflows
   - `memory/gary-context.md` - Personal history, family background, career arc
   - `memory/business-context.md` - Tech stack, systems, processes, document index
   - `memory/auto-learned.md` - Auto-discovered patterns
3. **Created slimmed drafts**:
   - `AGENTS-DRAFT.md` - 1614 bytes (under budget ✅)
   - `MEMORY-DRAFT.md` - 1776 bytes (under budget ✅)

### QMD Status
- 367 files indexed, 241 pending embedding
- 5 collections healthy: workspace, memory, grand-openings, trading, second-brain

### Patterns Discovered
- No formal memory tier system existed
- Both core files significantly bloated with detailed guidance better stored in queryable Tier 2
- Recent focus on Grand Opening Factory stability and production readiness
- Strong rule structure around agent cost management and sub-agent spawning

### Next Cycle Priorities
- Monitor file size drift
- Update auto-learned patterns based on user interactions
- Consider QMD embedding backlog (241 files)
