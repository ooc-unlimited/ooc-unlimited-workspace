## What Drives Him
- Self-made, resilient, grinder mentality
- Father's death without insurance is deeply personal
- Knows the gap between potential and execution
- Not afraid of starting over
- **His Why**: Help the person he was — broke, laid off, no warm market, stumbled into insurance with zero support
- Mission: condense timeline, help people like him start winning immediately
- Not just recruiting — rescuing

## Agent Code & Upline

## Family Motivation
- Jennifer needs to retire from her $72K job
- Every dollar of her income is needed currently
- Kids are young (Joli 10, Levin 6) — wants to provide better
- Father's end "could have been better with a policy" — believes he might still be alive
