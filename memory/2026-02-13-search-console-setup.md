**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Account:** wearegfi@oocunlimited.com

## ✅ Property Added & Verified
- **Property:** https://garylifeindex.com/ (URL prefix method)
- **Verification method:** HTML meta tag
- **Meta tag added to:** `onboarding-system/src/app/layout.tsx` via Next.js `metadata.verification.google`
- **Verification code:** `UtbsyO8otRWksWESnwO54gR-iBWI3E7STgENqqE1_Yo`
- **Status:** Ownership verified ✅

## ✅ Sitemap Submitted
- **URL:** https://garylifeindex.com/sitemap.xml
- **Submitted:** Feb 13, 2026
- **Initial status:** "Couldn't fetch" — this is normal for brand new submissions. Google will retry.
- **Note:** The "Couldn't fetch" may be due to Cloudflare challenge pages blocking Googlebot. Check back in 24-48h.

## ⚠️ Action Items
1. **Check sitemap status in 24-48h** — should change from "Couldn't fetch" to "Success"
2. If still failing, may need to:
   - Add a Cloudflare WAF rule to allow Googlebot user agents
   - Verify the Cloudflare tunnel isn't blocking Google's crawlers
   - Check `robots.txt` at https://garylifeindex.com/robots.txt
3. **Keep the meta tag** in layout.tsx permanently (required for ongoing verification)
