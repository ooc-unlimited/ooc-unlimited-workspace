**Date**: Feb 12, 2026 4:00 PM | **Source**: Granola MCP

## Prospect Profile
- **Name**: Sonji Tillman
- **Email**: sonjitillman46@gmail.com
- **Location**: Alabama/Mississippi (South)
- **License**: Alabama life license (may need renewal), previously had Mississippi license
- **Background**: Former school teacher assistant + Walmart (two jobs). Divorced. Grown children, grandchildren.
- **Experience**: Licensed since 2020, hasn't actively used it
- **Didn't know**: Her life license includes annuities

## Key Interests
- Part-time to start (busy with other ventures)
- Wants to open a soul food restaurant
- Wants to travel, help grandchildren with college
- Financially free = no debt, freedom to cruise/Europe

## Strong WHY
- **Son's wife died 2 years ago** — no life insurance. Family had to scramble for funeral costs.
- Sonji had been pressing her son for 1.5 years to get life insurance. He refused. Wife died 6 months after last conversation.
- "That's why I'm really adamant about selling life insurance"

## Objections / Timing
- Can't pay $199 this month — has other obligations
- Said **next month** she'll be ready to move forward
- Asked about pyramid scheme comparison (Gary handled well — explained tier differences from Primerica)
- Asked if million dollars possible in a year (Gary: yes, 18 millionaires in 18 months, but 59K agents — keep perspective)

## Gary's Performance
- Great rapport building (car accident story, food conversation, genuine connection)
- Good objection handling (Primerica, pyramid, realistic about millionaire odds)
- Explained compensation well ($164/mo policy = $1,968 annualized × 40% = $787 upfront)
- **Missed opportunity**: Could have tried to get $199 commitment for next month with a specific date
- **Good**: Didn't push too hard, respected her timing

## Next Steps
- Sonji will reach out when ready to pay $199 (targeting next month)
- Needs license renewal check (Karen, licensing coordinator)
- May need non-resident license for cross-state business
- Will meet with Lana for onboarding after ICA
