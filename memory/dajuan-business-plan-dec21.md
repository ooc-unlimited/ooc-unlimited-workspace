**Date**: December 21, 2025 | **Duration**: 63 min

## Gary's Top 5 Reasons for the Business
1. **Generational wealth** — money for kids and kids' kids
2. **Retire Jennifer** — she pulls ~$70K claimed (~$100K real), every dime needed for household
3. (continued in session but not all captured)

## Key Financial Numbers
- **Monthly expenses**: $4,400 (including mortgage)
- **Mortgage**: ~$1,700-1,800
- **Override level**: 60%
- **2025 stats**: 16 direct recruits, 44,244 net points
- **Jennifer's income**: Claims $72K, probably ~$100K real — 100% needed for household
- **Goal cash flow**: $566,000 by 12/12 event ($47,100/month)
- **Savings goal**: $58,000

## DC's Reverse Engineering (Prolific Minimums)
- **Minimums**: 2 directs + 10,000 points per month
- **At minimums**: 10,000 pts × 60% = $6,000/mo = **$72,000/yr** (exactly replaces Jennifer's claimed income)
- **With 6 solid people also doing minimums**: 
  - 6 × 10,000 pts/mo = 60,000 pts/mo
  - Override at 15% = $9,000/mo × 12 = $108,000/yr
  - Plus personal $72,000 = **$180,000 total**
- **After expenses**: $180K - $100K (family/house) = $80K → half to biz/taxes = **$40-50K savings**

## Gary's 2026 Goals
- **30 base recruits** for the year (stretch from 24 minimum)
- **$566,000 cash flow** by 12/12 event
- **5 EMDs by birthday** (May 23) — ready but not necessarily promoted
- **6 EMDs by June 30** (SEVP level)
- **10 new licensed agents by birthday**
- **$58,000 in savings**

## Promotion Path
- EMD requires 150,000 base points in 6 months
- DC says: "If EMD less than $250K, you're not a good EMD"
- Don't promote 1 unless you can promote 3 (need options)
- June 30th cycle target for Gary's EMD promotion + ring
- Systemized promotion process — match up with someone you trained down

## Key People Mentioned
- **Lana Da Roza** — Gary's upline/EMD
- **Justina** — Gary's recruit, producer, direct to Tanya (who's direct to Gary). Tanya leaving.
- **Rich Chandra** — New recruit, direct to Gary, Lana excited about her as exchange leg
- **Tyrone, Terrence (new), Aaron, Strawn, Joseph Castro Giovanni, Rudy Jimenez, Maria, Lacey** — Gary's 6+ active directs showing up

## DC's Action Items for Gary
1. **Master closing** — IUL and annuity specifically
2. **Watch Doug Andrews videos** (18 YouTube videos on IUL knowledge)
3. **Listen to Ed Mylett** — "The Eye Opener" + "How to Set Appointments" — EVERY DAY for 30 days
4. **Watch DC's wife's client presentation video** — study the closing process
5. **Carriers to master**: F&G (IUL + annuity), Corbridge (term), Ethos (term). North American blocked by credit but DC will try to get him contracted.
6. **Every new direct → make them a client** (5,000 points each = ~$400/mo premium for family)
7. **EMD Plan to Focus PowerPoint** — DC sharing this

## DC's Math: January Target
- Gary + 6 people × 3 directs each = 18 base recruits in month 1
- 18 × 5,000 pts = 90,000 points (60% of EMD requirement in ONE month)

## Key Insights
- "We don't just recruit licensed agents. We've got to tap with them and help them become clients." — DC
- Volume solves everything — "You solve it with volume"
- Gary is a **recruiter** who taught a producer (Justina) to recruit — rare and valuable
- DC's staff handles: chargebacks tracking, cycle payouts, appointment scheduling, PowerPoints
- DC listens to Eye Opener EVERY DAY before appointments — credits it for his million+ income
- 95% of EMDs never make MVP — can't handle people problems, not assertive enough
- "Even when things are on fire at home, you show up and train your team"

## Carriers
- **F&G** — IUL + annuity (Gary's primary, can get contracted)
- **Corbridge** — term life
- **Ethos** — term life (quick issue)
- **North American** — blocked for Gary due to credit, DC will try to resolve

## Critical Gap Identified by DC
Gary recruits well but doesn't close (make recruits into clients). The business plan is: recruit → make them a client (5,000 pts) → train them to do the same. Closing is Gary's #1 skill gap.

## Part 2 — Leverage, Assertiveness, Staffing

### Matching Up Strategy
- Gary overrides Lana — so matching up with her is smart (free points flow up)
- DC never matches up with his upline (Paul/Randy) — "Why give them free business?"
- Mindset: "I know what I'm doing now" — be assertive about who you match with

### DC's Closing System
- Get client → get their list → go see their top 3 → join the team → speak the process
- "This is our system" — follow it to a T

### Gary's Staffing Question
- Gary feels like he's running a "voluntary army" — hard to be assertive with unpaid people
- Considered: should he hire a salesperson to feel comfortable being assertive?
- DC's answer: "If you've got to do all of them, then you do it"
- On Justina: if she won't run the system, don't match her up anymore. Use her points for EMD promotion but don't invest more time.
- People who want the system → run with them. People with ego → coach but don't invest heavily.

### DC's Team Performance Context
- DC: 150,000 pts this month alone (December, a slow month)
- DC's wife (Caitlin): 80,000 rolling 12
- Z (Prince Zeeshan): ~500K
- Raheem: ~400K
- Richard Robey: 150K (has big ego, knows what he's doing, DC coaches but doesn't run his business)
- Lana: ~80K

### Key Takeaway
"Stupid is as stupid does" — DC's 2026 theme: follow the leader or get left behind. The system works. The people who don't follow it plateau. Gary's job: be assertive, run the system, don't beg people to follow.

## Part 3 — Performance Examples & Final Directives

### Team Performance Rankings (DC's team, Jan-Dec 2025)
- Lana: #16 at 76,000 pts
- David Avila: 77,000 pts (just above Lana)
- Liz Hernandez: 75,000 pts (just below Lana)
- One guy hit 50K watch on March 31st → now at 166K → probably 200K by year end
- Walter: below 300K despite hitting 375K — "still thinking his way is the way"
- Z (Prince Zeeshan): ~500K
- Raheem: ~400K

### DC's Philosophy on Following the System
- "McDonald's don't have a way for their people. There's no 'their people.' It's a system and whoever is in it, they're in it."
- Good examples and bad examples — find your way
- Upline ≠ business example. "Randy's lucky to override me. That's it."
- Gary should think the same about Lana

### Final Directives from DC
1. **Learn how to close** — #1 priority
2. **Stop defaulting to matching up** — make them YOUR client, YOUR 5,000 points × YOUR 60% contract
3. **Be assertive** — don't beg people to follow the system
4. **Follow the leader who produces** — not just whoever is upline
5. **5,000 pts × 60% = $3,000 per client** — that's what Gary leaves on the table every time he matches up instead of closing himself

## Part 4 — The Close (DC's Final Words)

### The Mantra
"Gary, how do you replace your wife's income?" → "By doing the minimums, coach."
- DC says repeat this constantly — 3AM, 1AM, 8PM, 6AM
- $3,000 per client closed personally (5,000 pts × 60%)
- 2 clients = $6,000/mo = $72,000/yr = Jennifer's income replaced
- **Matching up = giving away Jen's money**

### DC's Shared Documents (3 files)
1. Business Plan
2. Client Experience
3. Industry Comp
- Saved in Gary's prolific files

### Session Summary
DC's core message in one line: "You're good enough. Do the minimums. Close your own clients. Be assertive. Volume solves everything."
