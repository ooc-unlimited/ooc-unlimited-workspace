# 2026-02-10 — Daily Log

## Late Night Session (Gary up at 1:15 AM)
- Gary finalized the entire onboarding flow
- Spec saved to `garys-onboarding-automation-spec.md`

## Key Decisions Made
- "Dream Flu Shot" renamed to **"Expect the Pushback"**
- Building an Empire audiobook link: Google Drive (assigned as homework before CE Part 1)
- "Expect the Pushback" email includes: inoculation content + audiobook link + Calendly link
- CE Part 1: Onboarding 1 slides → Agency Rocket webinar → Tevah PFR → Ethos income protection
- CE Part 2: Review numbers → Agency Rocket comparison tool (retirement) → close business
- After CE Part 2 → schedule Onboarding 2 (HOT) — run by CFTs
- 7 Fundamentals: Phone call, Edify, Conversation, Answer questions, Product knowledge, Clo"Z"ing, Duplication
- PhoneZones: Mondays 8 PM EST
- Ethos for income protection (new tool — not previously in stack)
- 7-day filter: "engaged" = listened to some of Building an Empire
- Field training independence varies per person

## New Tools Identified
- **Ethos**: Income protection policy platform (used in CE Part 1 close)
- **Agency Rocket**: Webinar (CE Part 1) + comparison tool for retirement (CE Part 2)

## Overnight Queue Updated
- Priority: Build onboarding automation system
- Expect the Pushback email template
- Ringy browser automation
- Pipeline tracker (11 stages)
