## 📌 LINKEDIN POST

I got laid off from Best Buy with $100K in debt and a family to feed.

Then my father passed — no life insurance. I watched my family scramble to bury someone they loved. That moment changed everything.

I didn't get into insurance to chase commissions. I got in because I never wanted another family to go through what mine did.

That's why I built OOC Unlimited around one principle:

**Mission before commission.**

We solve problems first. We protect families first. The money follows when you actually give a damn.

If you're a licensed agent tired of being treated like a number — we do it different here.

**Caption:**
$100K in debt. Laid off. Lost my father with no life insurance.

That's not a sob story — that's my WHY.

Every agent I recruit. Every family we protect. Every policy we write. It all comes back to one thing:

Mission before commission. 🎯

This isn't a slogan. It's how we move at OOC Unlimited.

You solve the problem first. You show up for the family first. You earn it by being real — not by chasing comp.

**Visual suggestion:** Dark background, bold white text "MISSION BEFORE COMMISSION" with Gary's photo or a candid shot. Keep it raw, not polished.

Real talk.

My dad died without life insurance. I was already $100K in debt after getting laid off from Best Buy. I had to figure out how to survive AND how to make sure no other family went through that.

That's how I found insurance. Not for the money — for the mission.

Now I lead OOC Unlimited and we run on a simple rule:

**Mission before commission.**

That means we don't recruit agents to hit quotas. We recruit people who actually want to help families. We train you. We support you. And we put the client first — always.

If that sounds like the kind of team you want to be on, hit me up or visit garylifeindex.com/join 💪

## 📖 BRAND MESSAGING GUIDE — "Mission Before Commission"

**What it means:**
At OOC Unlimited, we solve problems before we sell products. Every interaction starts with the family's need — not the commission check. This isn't charity; it's how you build a business that lasts.

**Where it comes from:**
Gary lost his father without life insurance. He knows what it costs when nobody shows up for a family. OOC exists so that doesn't happen to anyone else.

**How we use it:**
- When recruiting: "We're not looking for closers. We're looking for people on a mission."
- When training: "Learn the product so you can solve the problem. The comp follows."
- When selling: "What does this family actually need?" — that's always question one.

**What it's NOT:**
- It's not anti-money. Agents eat. Agents get paid well.
- It's not soft. It's strategic — mission-driven agents retain better, sell more, and build trust faster.
- It's not a hashtag. It's the operating system.

**Voice guide:** Direct. Personal. No corporate fluff. Talk like you've been there — because Gary has.
