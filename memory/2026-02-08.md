## 9:19 PM — Gary Brain Dump: RITA & Cody
- **Cody** = nickname for Codex CLI. Gary/Donna shorthand: "Have Cody do it" = use Codex for coding.
- **RITA** = "Recruiting Is The Answer" — Gary's core philosophy. Every problem in the business gets solved by recruiting more. Entire wing of the company dedicated to recruiting.
- **Recruit everybody, then filter**: Cast widest net possible (not just licensed agents — everybody), then select for coachability and fit. This is an evolution from licensed-only sourcing.
- Building an Empire transcription COMPLETED: 43/43 chunks, 434,783 chars total.

## 11:48 PM — Gary Confirms NQ Trading System Build
- Watched Aaron Dishner's OpenClaw trading video (Coin Bureau). Same setup: Mac Mini, cron jobs, TradingView indicators, backtesting, paper trading dashboards.
- Gary confirmed: build his NQ trading setup the same way.
- Added to overnight queue as Priority 1.

## Naming Convention (Company Framework)
- **Donna** ⚡ = Chief of Staff (me)
- **Me-Lin** 🎯 = Zoom Executive Assistant (meetings, recordings, breakout rooms, screen sharing)
- **Cody** 🔧 = Codex CLI (coding)
- **RITA** 🎯 = "Recruiting Is The Answer" (core business philosophy)
- **Papa Kapp** 📚 = Brian Carruthers / Building an Empire (values/mentor/moral compass)

## Alex Grey Interview (Feb 8, 50 min)
- Licensed Dec 16, 2025. Former truck driver ($10K/month), timeshare sales vet (7 years Orlando)
- Currently with Globe Life — hates it (micromanaged, endless training, zero income)
- Port Charlotte FL, bilingual (English/Spanish), no car
- Has 45 warm referrals from SalesBase AI that Globe Life NEVER CALLED
- Existing carrier appointments: F&G, Foresters, Mutual of Omaha, Baltimore Life
- Agreed to fill out ICA, needs 1-2 days to fund account for $199
- Score: 6.5/10 — great rapport but too long (50 min), missed urgency on 45 leads, told him to "wait"
- Reminder set for Monday 2PM to follow up

## Grand Openings — Three Approaches Captured
1. **Prince Z** (Prince Zeeshan Ali) — Automated, Luma platform, certification program, drip info. 300-person list. Gary's preferred model.
2. **Dajuan** (Coach Dewan) — High-energy, accountability, 100→50→25→10 funnel. Social media FOMO. Restaurant analogy. Full T3 2024 PowerPoint (28 slides).
3. **Florio** (Florio & Lauraai Mazares) — Systematic, 11 ways to grand open. ETHOR script. 10:6:3:1 conversion. Three-part framework (Marketing → Presentation → Follow-up).

Gary wants Prince Z style as foundation, fully automated via Luma. New prospects just provide socials — we handle everything.
