**Trigger**: ICA signed + $199 paid

**Channel**: Email + SMS

## OBJECTION RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### "$199 is too much"
**Response**: "I understand [Name]. Here's the thing - most licensed agents spend $199/month on leads that don't convert. This is one-time, gets you the system + warm leads + personal mentorship. Sarah made $8,200 month 2. ROI in first week. Still concerns?"

### "Don't want to build a team"  
**Response**: "[Name], totally optional. 60% of our agents stay solo and do $5-8K/month with just warm leads. Team building is for those who want $15K+. Your choice entirely. Sound fair?"

### "Commission split too low"
**Response**: "Fair point [Name]. Most IMOs give higher splits on cold leads you generate yourself. We provide warm leads + all support. Higher volume × lower split = more money. Would you rather have 90% of zero or 70% of $8K? Math works."

### "Lead quality concerns"
**Response**: "[Name], I get it - been burned by bad leads? Our leads are pre-qualified + actively looking. Sarah closed 3 of her first 5. If first 20 leads don't produce results, I'll personally work with you 1:1 until they do. Fair?"

## REFERRAL INCENTIVE MESSAGING

### To Active Agents
**Message**: "[Name], quick opportunity: Know any licensed agents looking for better income? I pay $500 for successful referrals + you get overrides on their production. Passive income from people you help. Interested in details?"

### Follow-up
**Message**: "Here's how it works: You refer licensed agent → They join GFI → You get $500 immediately + 5% override on their commissions forever. Win-win-win. Who comes to mind?"

## GROUP TRAINING COHORT INVITES

### March Cohort Launch
**Message**: "🎯 [Name], you're invited to March's exclusive training cohort. 12 agents max. Group support, accountability, competition. Starts March 1st. Better results in groups vs solo training. You in?"

### Follow-up for Committed Agents
**Message**: "March cohort confirmed [Name]! You'll be training with 11 other motivated agents. First Zoom: March 1st, 7 PM EST. Calendar invite coming. This is where agents go from solo strugglers to success stories! 🔥"
