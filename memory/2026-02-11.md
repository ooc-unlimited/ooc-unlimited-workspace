   - Interactive logging, daily/weekly/monthly stats, markdown export
   - Tracks: strategy, direction, entry/exit, points, P&L, grade, plan adherence, emotions, setup notes
   - Seeded with Feb 9 paper trades (3 trades, +31.50 pts)
   - Commands: `log`, `today`, `week`, `stats`, `export`, `add <json>`
   
2. **`trading/session-analyzer.py`** (~7.6K) — Post-session market analysis
   - Reads price-log JSONL files, breaks down by session (Globex/NY Open/Morning/Lunch/Afternoon)
   - Volatility metrics, key levels, VWAP proxy, potential setup detection
   - Multi-day range analysis
   
3. **`trading/pre-market-prep.py`** (~6.3K) — Morning game plan generator
   - Fetches live NQ price, prior session levels, recent trade performance
   - Generates structured trading plan with key levels, position context, Hougaard quotes
   - Tested live: NQ at 25,266.50, below prior low (breakdown territory)

### Onboarding Dashboard — Verified ✅

- All pages functional: Dashboard, Agents, Alerts, SMS Templates, Pushback Email, Metrics, Grand Openings

### Trading Journal Directory Created
- `trading/journal/` — stores daily trade JSON files
- First entries: 2026-02-11.json with 3 seeded trades from Feb 9 session

## Zoom Morning Opening Skill — BUILT
- Skill at /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/zoom-morning-opening/
- 8 scripts: run-all.sh + step0 through step6
- Decision tree follows Gary's exact spec
- Sub-agent debugged scripts (rewrote to avoid slow accessibility searches)
- Key learning: Audio dialog has no X, must click "Continue" button; Escape doesn't work
- Gary's feedback incorporated: no Home sidebar "More", no "Meetings" tab, audio always skipped, only Gary gets co-host
- Still needs more testing before 9 AM cron
