**Company:** OOC Unlimited / GFI  
**Location:** Remote (Virtual Office)  
**Type:** Full-Time or Part-Time Contract  

---

## About Us

We're a fast-growing financial services team within GFI focused on recruiting, training, and developing licensed insurance agents. We operate the PROLIFIC system — a proven, repeatable framework for recruiting, onboarding, and field training. We need someone who can run the operational engine so our leadership can focus on what they do best: recruiting and closing.

## The Role

You'll be the **operational backbone** of our recruiting pipeline. Your job is to make sure every new recruit moves through our onboarding process like clockwork — no one falls through the cracks, no delays, no excuses.

## What You'll Do

### Onboarding & Scheduling
- Schedule each new recruit's licensing exam **immediately** upon recruitment
- Book the 2-part Client Experience (CE) within 48 hours of recruiting
- Manage Calendly links and appointment scheduling between recruits and trainers
- Track where every recruit is in the onboarding pipeline (exam → CE Part 1 → CE Part 2 → field training)

### Pipeline Management
- Maintain a real-time roster of all recruits and their onboarding status
- Follow up with recruits who stall or go dark
- Ensure no recruit waits more than 24 hours without a next step
- Track licensing status, exam dates, and compliance deadlines

### Systems & Admin
- Manage CRM (Ringy) — keep records updated, run follow-up sequences
- Maintain the PROLIFIC Google Drive materials (read-only access management)
- Coordinate scheduling for PhoneZones, Zoom meetings, and training sessions
- Pull weekly metrics: recruits, licenses, points, stick rate

### Communication
- Serve as the first point of contact for new recruits after sign-up
- Send reminders, confirmations, and follow-ups
- Coordinate between MDs, trainers, and recruits to eliminate scheduling gaps

## Who You Are

- **Relentlessly organized** — you live in spreadsheets, CRMs, and calendars
- **Fast responder** — same-day turnaround is your default, not your stretch goal
- **Process-driven** — you follow the system exactly and flag deviations
- **Comfortable with volume** — we recruit aggressively; you need to keep pace
- **Tech-savvy** — CRM tools, Google Workspace, Zoom, Calendly are second nature
- **Insurance/financial services background is a plus** but not required

## Requirements

- 2+ years in operations, admin, or coordinator role (recruiting ops preferred)
- Experience with CRM platforms (Ringy, Salesforce, or similar)
- Strong written communication skills
- Available during business hours EST + evening PhoneZone sessions (2-3x/week)
- Reliable internet and quiet workspace

## Compensation

- Competitive hourly rate or monthly retainer (based on experience)
- Performance bonuses tied to recruit stick rate and licensing metrics
- Growth path into team leadership as the organization scales

## How to Apply

Send a brief intro and your resume. Tell us about a time you managed a high-volume pipeline and kept nothing from falling through the cracks.
