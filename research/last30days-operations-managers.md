# Last 30 Days: Operations Managers — AI, Automation & Best Practices
*Researched: February 12, 2026*

## What I Learned

**Agentic AI Is the #1 Ops Trend of 2026** — The shift from passive AI tools to autonomous AI agents that can independently execute workflows is the dominant theme. These agents open tickets, change configurations, validate outcomes, and remediate incidents without human intervention. Per 360 Smart Networks and Salesforce's 2026 trends reports, "agentic AI" is the top trend reshaping operations.

**AI Is Now Operational Infrastructure, Not a Side Project** — Per Cloud Solutions Tech, businesses that treat AI as strategic infrastructure are outperforming those that treat it as a trend. AI is embedded into core enterprise systems, supporting day-to-day operational decisions and actively influencing business outcomes. HBR's February 2026 report notes AI layoffs are outpacing AI productivity gains, meaning companies are replacing ops roles, not just augmenting them.

**Small Businesses Are Running Lean Ops with AI Tools** — Per Entrepreneur magazine, solopreneurs are running entire businesses with 7 AI tools and no staff. The "one-person ops team" powered by AI is becoming viable for the first time.

**Governance and Trust Are the Bottleneck** — Salesforce's simulation environments train AI agents on synthetic scenarios before deployment. The key question across all sources: who's accountable when the AI ops manager makes a mistake?

## KEY PATTERNS

1. **Agentic AI replaces task-by-task automation** — Instead of automating individual tasks, AI agents now manage entire workflows end-to-end (incident response, pipeline management, scheduling chains)
2. **AI-first operations** — Companies are designing processes around AI, not bolting AI onto existing processes
3. **Workflow redesign > job replacement** — HBS recommends redesigning workflows, not just replacing jobs; invest in AI literacy across 30% of the organization
4. **Simulation before deployment** — Train AI agents in sandbox environments before letting them manage real operations
5. **Small business accessibility** — Tools like Lindy, Zapier AI, and Sintra make AI ops management affordable ($29-99/month)

## Best Practices for AI Operations Management

### From Harvard Business School (Feb 2026)
- **Build "change fitness"** — Invest in broad AI literacy, not just tech teams
- **Redesign workflows, not just jobs** — Rethink processes from scratch around AI capabilities
- **Organize AI around business strategy** — Sequence AI adoption based on your actual goals
- **Reward learning speed and outcomes** over credentials

### From Cloud Solutions Tech
- **Treat AI as shared infrastructure** — One AI platform serving multiple departments
- **Intelligent Process Automation** — AI interprets unstructured data (documents, emails, images), learns from patterns, adapts workflows
- **Governance first** — Explainable AI, transparency, data/security foundations before scaling

### From Salesforce 2026 Trends
- **Ambient intelligence** — AI that operates in the background, always monitoring
- **Semantic layer for agent collaboration** — Multiple AI agents coordinating via shared understanding
- **Simulation environments** — Test AI agents on synthetic scenarios before real deployment

## How Companies Are Using AI Ops Managers

- **Virgin Media O2**: Deployed Strategy AI's Risk Insights Bot for automated risk reporting, QA workflows, and data alignment
- **Solopreneurs (per Entrepreneur)**: Running entire businesses with 7 AI tools — no staff, no overhead
- **Small businesses report 50-80% time savings** on admin tasks using tools like Lindy and Zapier AI
- **One-person ops teams** are scaling without headcount growth using AI agent stacks

## What This Means for an AI Operations Manager Like Stacy

### Direct Applications
1. **Agentic workflow management** — Stacy should manage entire workflow chains (recruit → onboard → train → track), not just individual tasks
2. **Pipeline automation** — Automated CRM follow-ups, lead scoring, and pipeline progression tracking (similar to what HubSpot AI and Lindy do)
3. **Proactive monitoring** — Like the "ambient intelligence" trend, Stacy should surface issues before they become problems (recruit falling off, license expiring, chargebacks incoming)
4. **Simulation/testing** — Before rolling out new workflows, test them in sandbox mode
5. **Multi-department coordination** — Act as shared infrastructure across recruiting, compliance, training, and commission tracking

### Competitive Advantage
- Most companies are still using AI for isolated tasks. An integrated AI ops manager that coordinates across the entire business operation is ahead of the curve
- The "one-person ops team" trend validates the concept — Gary + Stacy could run ops that normally require 3-5 people
- Key differentiator: Stacy can combine Tevah data, Ringy pipeline, PropHog leads, and calendar/email into one unified operations view
