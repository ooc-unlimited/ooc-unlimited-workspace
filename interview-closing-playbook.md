# Interview Closing Playbook
### The Zoom Framework — From "Hello" to "Here's Your ICA"
*Based on Terreance Taylor interview analysis + GFI best practices*

---

## Pre-Interview Checklist (Do This BEFORE the Zoom)

### Know Your Prospect (5 min prep)
- [ ] Name, state, license status (PropHog data)
- [ ] Current or previous company (if known from texts)
- [ ] Any personal details from SMS conversation
- [ ] Have their iDecide presentation ready (their name entered)
- [ ] ICA link ready to send
- [ ] Calendly link for Lana/upline intro (if closing on call)

### Tech Setup
- [ ] Zoom link sent and confirmed
- [ ] Camera ON (non-negotiable — you're building trust)
- [ ] Clean background, good lighting
- [ ] Screen share ready for iDecide (if needed)
- [ ] Phone on silent
- [ ] Ringy open with their contact pulled up

### Mindset
You're not selling. You're interviewing THEM. The frame is: "I'm looking for the right person to join my team." This is selective, not desperate. If they're not a fit, you tell them. That's the energy.

---

## The Interview Framework (25-30 Minutes)

### Phase 1: Rapport (2-3 min MAX)

**Goal:** Human connection, not small talk. Get in, get warm, get moving.

Opening:
> "Hey [Name], glad we could connect. How's your day going?"

Let them answer. One follow-up question max. Then transition:

> "Cool. Well, I appreciate you taking the time. I know you're busy, so let me tell you how this is going to work — I'm going to ask you a few questions to see if this is a mutual fit, I'll walk you through what we do, and then we'll see if it makes sense to move forward. Sound good?"

**Why this works:** Sets the frame. They're being evaluated too. This isn't a pitch — it's a conversation between equals.

**⚠️ Common mistake:** Spending 10 minutes on rapport. Gary's natural warmth is an asset but it delays the business conversation. Cap rapport at 3 minutes. The relationship builds throughout the call, not just the opening.

---

### Phase 2: Discovery (8-10 min)

**Goal:** Understand their situation, motivation, and urgency level. Let them talk 80%.

#### The Discovery Funnel

**Level 1 — Situation** (Where are you now?)
> "So tell me about your background in the industry. Where are you now, and what's been your experience?"

Listen for: current company, production level, frustrations, licensing details.

**Level 2 — Motivation** (What do you want?)
> "If everything went right over the next 12 months, what does that look like for you financially?"

Listen for: income targets, lifestyle goals, family motivations.

**Level 3 — Pain** (Why isn't it working now?)
> "So what's been the biggest frustration with your current situation? What's stopped you from getting there?"

Listen for: bad upline, no training, no leads, low comp, broken promises.

**Level 4 — Urgency** (How serious are you?)
> "On a scale of 1-10, how serious are you about making a change? And what would need to happen to make it a 10?"

Listen for: timeline, commitment level, obstacles.

#### The Competitor Contrast Technique

If they're at another company (like Terreance was at North American Senior Investment):

> "Tell me more about that experience. What did they promise vs. what actually happened?"

**Let them sell themselves on leaving.** Don't trash the other company — let them do it. Then:

> "That's frustrating. Nobody should go through that. And honestly, that's exactly why I do what I do — because I went through the same thing when I started."

**Gary's story drops here.** Short version — 2 minutes max:
> "When I got into this industry, I was dead broke. $100K in debt. Found this on ZipRecruiter. Nobody showed me anything — I had to figure it all out myself. That experience is why I build my team differently. I don't bring people on and abandon them."

---

### Phase 3: The Bridge (2-3 min)

**Goal:** Connect their pain to your solution. This is the transition from discovery to presentation.

> "So let me make sure I'm hearing you right: you want [their goal], you're frustrated with [their pain], and you're looking for [what they said they need]. Is that accurate?"

Wait for confirmation. Then:

> "Good. Because what I'm going to show you addresses all of that. Let me walk you through how we operate — and more importantly, how we're different from what you've experienced."

---

### Phase 4: Presentation (5-7 min)

**Option A — iDecide (preferred for warm/high-interest prospects)**
> "I'm going to send you a quick interactive presentation. It'll take about 10 minutes — you can go through it while we're on the call or after. It covers our comp structure, products, training, and support system."

Share the iDecide link. If they're engaged, walk through it together.

**Option B — Verbal Walkthrough (for people who want conversation, not slides)**

Cover these points in ORDER:

1. **The Company** — GFI, what we do, how long we've been around
2. **The Products** — Life insurance, IULs, annuities, mortgage protection — families need this
3. **The Comp** — First-year commissions, renewals, overrides, bonuses (see objection scripts if they push back)
4. **The Training** — Onboarding system, field training, ongoing support
5. **The Difference** — "Here's what makes us different: I personally train every agent on my team. You're not getting passed to a 22-year-old who just started. You're getting me."

**⚠️ Key:** Don't spend 15 minutes here. Hit the highlights and move to the close. The longer you present, the less time for closing, and that's where Gary has historically lost deals.

---

### Phase 5: The Close (5-7 min)

**This is where the $199 happens. This is the whole point of the call.**

#### Trial Close
> "Based on everything we've talked about — does this sound like something that makes sense for you?"

If yes → move to the commitment.
If hesitant → address the specific concern (see objection scripts).
If no → "I appreciate your honesty. What part doesn't line up for you?"

#### The Commitment Ask

> "Great. So here's how we get started: there's a one-time $199 activation fee that covers your agent code, background check, Ethos website, and full access to our training platform. I can send you the link right now and we'll have you set up today. Want me to send it over?"

**Key language:**
- "One-time" — not recurring
- "Activation fee" — not a cost, it activates something
- "Right now" — urgency
- "We'll have you set up today" — immediate gratification

#### If They Say Yes
1. Send the ICA link IMMEDIATELY (while on the call)
2. Walk them through filling it out
3. Set the next step: "Once that's processed, I'll introduce you to our onboarding coordinator and we'll schedule your first training this week."
4. Give a specific timeline: "Expect to be writing business within 10-14 days."

#### If They Hesitate

> "What's holding you back? Is it the $199, or is it something else?"

Address whatever they say. Then:

> "Look, I'm not going to pressure you. But I will tell you this: the people who move fast in this business are the ones who succeed. Every day you wait is a day you're not earning. I've got [X people] starting onboarding this week — I'd love to have you in that group. But it's your call."

#### If They Say "Let Me Think About It"

> "Of course. I respect that. Let me ask you one thing though: what specifically do you need to think about? Because if there's a concern I can address right now, I'd rather handle it than leave you wondering."

If they give a real concern → address it.
If they're just stalling → set a concrete follow-up:

> "No problem. I'll check in with you [tomorrow/day after]. But just so you know — I'm building my team right now and spots fill up. I don't want you to miss the window."

**⚠️ NEVER end with "I'll text you the info."** That's where the Terreance interview died. Always close on the call or set a specific follow-up time.

## Zoom Scorecard

Fill this out after EVERY interview. Be honest. Track trends over time.

| Category | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Rapport** — Did I connect? | /5 | |
| **Discovery** — Did I understand their situation? | /5 | |
| **Story** — Did I share my story effectively? | /5 | |
| **Presentation** — Was it clear and concise? | /5 | |
| **Close** — Did I ask for the commitment? | /5 | |
| **Urgency** — Did I create a reason to act now? | /5 | |
| **Objections** — Did I handle pushback well? | /5 | |
| **Next Steps** — Are they clear on what happens? | /5 | |
| **TOTAL** | /40 | |

### Scoring Guide
- **32-40:** Excellent. This is the standard.
- **24-31:** Good call, clear areas to improve.
- **16-23:** Significant gaps. Review and practice.
- **Below 16:** Full reset. Practice the framework before next call.

### Comparison: Terreance Taylor Call
Gary scored 6.3/10 on that call (roughly 25/40 on this scale). Strengths: rapport (5/5), discovery (4/5). Weaknesses: close (2/5), urgency (1/5). The fix is straightforward — Phase 5 needs to happen on every call.
