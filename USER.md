# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Gary Cosby
- **What to call them:** Gary
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** America/New_York (EST)
- **Telegram:** @Gary_Cosby (id: 1056863555)
- **Location:** Orlando, Florida

## Background

- Born May 23, 1982 in Stamford, Connecticut
- Mother was a nurse, father was a police officer
- Sister, 4 years younger
- Parents divorced when young — father lost his job, mother moved to Florida with his sister
- Gary stayed with father in CT until father was jailed for selling drugs
- Moved to Florida to live with mother and sister, finished high school there
- All-state high school football player, also played basketball
- As a child, a doctor sewed a piece of glass into his throat during stitches — settlement money his father grew to $100K+ in the stock market
- Walked on to UCF football team (University of Central Florida)
- After 2 years, tried out for Arena Football League — blew hamstring during 40-yard dash, ending football career

## Career Arc

- Worked three jobs simultaneously: Cingular Wireless/AT&T, nightclub bouncer (later manager), Best Buy (full-time)
- At peak: ~$60K in 401K, $10K in bank, ~$17K cash at home
- Regular Vegas trips for gambling and UFC fights
- 401K withdrawals over the years (wife's student loans, etc.) — penalties didn't matter, solved immediate needs
- Nearly 23 years at Best Buy — fired (justified, was quietly quitting — knew he didn't want to be there)
- Post-firing: dead broke, ~$100K in debt, all savings gone
- Found a ZipRecruiter posting promising $3-10K/month — applied naively, got licensed
- Onboarding was rough — passed between people, left to figure it out alone
- Almost 2 years in: 40+ licensed agents on his team, Marketing Director at his firm
- Most recent check: $12,000 (single check, not monthly)

## Family

- **Wife:** Jennifer — married October 28, 2011. Canadian citizen, no intention of becoming US citizen.
- **Daughter:** Joli — born March 17, 2016
- **Son:** Levin — born March 13, 2020
- **Mother:** alive, born February 18, 1953
- **Father:** deceased — pancreatic cancer. Did not have life insurance. Sister cared for him but his end could have been better with a policy. Gary believes he might still be here.
- **Sister:** 4 years younger, took care of their father at the end

## What Drives Him

- Self-made, resilient, grinder mentality
- Father's death without life insurance is personal — informs his current work
- Knows the gap between potential and execution — wishes he'd known what he knows now back when cash flow was highest
- Not afraid of starting over
- **His Why:** Wants to help the person he was — the broke, laid off guy with no warm market who stumbled into insurance with zero support. The industry works ($12K in 45 min proves it), but the onboarding and path to success is broken. His mission is to condense that timeline and help people like him start winning immediately. Not just recruiting — rescuing.

## Notes

- Don't sugarcoat things — Gary's been through enough to handle directness
- His story is one of reinvention — respect that
