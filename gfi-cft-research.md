# GFI CFT Research — Round 2 (Freelancer Focus)
**Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Objective:** Find a freelance/contract GFI Certified Field Trainer (CFT) for Gary

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**No ready-made freelance GFI CFT exists on any platform searched.** This role doesn't exist in the freelance economy — GFI's structure keeps trainers locked inside the hierarchy (they earn overrides, not fees). Nobody has posted "GFI field trainer for hire" anywhere. However, we found actionable leads and a concrete plan to CREATE this hire.

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)
1. **DM the r/Scams poster** who left GFI — they have insider knowledge and are no longer bound to GFI. Ask if they'd freelance-train Gary's recruits on the system.
2. **Contact "Daryl"** via Thinkific — he built an entire parallel training course. Find his full name via Facebook/LinkedIn search for "Daryl" + "Global Financial Impact"
3. **Contact Marty Landau** (West Palm Beach CFT) — he's an active CFT, possibly open to side work
4. **DM Emma Peschel** on Instagram — newly promoted CFT, may be open to contractor training gigs

### SHORT-TERM (This Month)
5. **Post in these Facebook groups** with a job posting:
   - Help for Insurance Agents
   - Insurance Agent Opportunities (USA)
   - Life Insurance Agents Success Network
6. **Post on Upwork** — here's the exact copy:

> **Title:** GFI (Global Financial Impact) Certified Field Trainer Needed — Remote Contract
> 
> **Description:** Looking for someone with hands-on experience in the GFI (Global Financial Impact) system to provide onboarding and field training for a small team of newly recruited agents. Must be familiar with:
> - The PROLIFIC onboarding system
> - 7 Fundamentals training
> - iDecide presentation tool
> - Carrier appointments (NLG, Foresters, Ethos, Athene)
> - CFT checklist and promotion pathway
> 
> This is a part-time, ongoing contract role. You'll be training 3-5 new recruits per month via Zoom. Ideal candidate is a current or former GFI Certified Field Trainer or higher.
> 
> **Budget:** $30-50/hr  
> **Hours:** 10-15 hrs/week

7. **Post on Fiverr** — similar listing targeting "insurance agent training" niche

### NUCLEAR OPTION
8. **Post on r/forhire** with similar copy adapted for Reddit
9. **Search r/antiMLM** for people who left GFI — some may be willing to do the training work without the MLM structure
10. **Contact GFI's Thinkific trainers directly** — Sidney, Brittany Russo, Rob Chan may do training independently
