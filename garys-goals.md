# Gary's Goals — Brain Dump (Feb 12, 2026)

## The Number
**$556,000 cash flow by May 23, 2026 (birthday)**
- Moonshot: $556K ($159K/mo for 3.5 months)
- Realistic floor: $165K ($47K/mo) — still replaces Jennifer's income 2x over
- Either outcome is a win

## The Method
1. **Recruit** — both licensed AND non-licensed people
2. **Sell them a policy** — moral responsibility, we own what we talk about ("sharing, not selling")
3. **Get referrals** — every policy client introduces their top 3 friends/acquaintances
4. **One joins the team** — out of every 3 referrals, recruit one as an agent
5. **Repeat** — train new agents to do exactly the same cycle
6. **Delegate within ~1 month** — Gary does the system himself for a month, then hands off to someone else while he focuses on automation + team growth

## Recruiting Targets
- Current best month: 7-8 agents
- Goal: **double-digit recruiting per month** (what the industry giants do)
- Stretch: **triple-digit recruiting** — blow people out of the water
- RITA is always on his mind: Recruiting Is The Answer

## The Trainer Problem
- Gary has a few downline agents willing to train his new recruits
- **Problem**: Trainers are getting upset — they get no financial benefit because Gary gets the override, not them
- **Options being considered**:
  1. Constant flow of new trainers (seems like what everyone does — unsustainable)
  2. Pay a training team out of pocket (but starting at $0 cash flow right now)
- **Not yet solved** — needs a sustainable model

## Current Reality
- Starting from $0 cash flow right now
- The only way to make money: sell policies
- Gary believes this is very doable

## Key Principles
- "Sharing, not selling" — we own what we talk about
- Moral responsibility to protect families
- Recruit everybody (RITA)
- System should be duplicatable — train agents to repeat the exact cycle
- Gary wants to focus on automation + team growth, not be the one doing everything forever
