# Gary's Goals — Brain Dump

*Last updated: 2026-02-14*

## 🎯 The Number
- **$556K cash flow by May 23, 2026** (44th birthday)
- **Floor: $165K** (minimum acceptable)
- Starting from $0 cash flow (as of Feb 2026)

## 💰 DC's Path to EMD
- 30 recruits/year → 6 solid doing minimums
- Each solid agent: 2 directs + 10K pts/mo = $6K/mo override
- 6 × $6K = $36K/mo = **$432K/yr**
- EMD promotion target: June 30, 2026
- Jennifer retired when override hits $72K/yr (6 agents × $12K/yr)

## 📊 Recruiting Goals
- Double-digit → **triple-digit monthly recruiting** (best month ever: 7-8)
- Target: 30+ recruits/month
- Current pipeline: PropHog → Ringy → iDecide → Zoom → ICA → Onboarding
- Fix the stick rate: currently ~5-10%, need 20%+
- **RITA**: Recruiting Is The Answer — always

## 🏗️ Systems to Build
- Duplicatable onboarding that works WITHOUT Gary on every call
- DC's 3-part onboarding system: CE Part 1 → CE Part 2 → HOT → Field Training
- GHL automations: 7-day drip, post-grand opening, mid-month check-in, stall alerts
- Grand Opening system that creates urgency and community

## 💼 Sales Goals
- Gary must close his OWN clients (stop matching up with downline)
- Products: F&G IUL, Corbridge Term, Ethos Term, Ameritas Whole Life
- Build client pipeline in GHL separate from recruiting pipeline
- Every new recruit → sell them a policy → get 3 referrals → recruit 1

## 👥 Team Building
- Delegate within 1 month (by March 2026)
- Trainer problem: no override benefit for downline trainers — unsolved
- Need field trainers who can run Grand Openings independently
- Matt Welsh / Coach DC methodology as the training standard

## 📈 Key Metrics to Track (Tevah)
- Recruits per month
- Life licenses issued
- Net licenses (licenses minus lapses)
- Total points
- Points per recruit
- Net license ratio
- Cash flow
- % recruits with license
- Revenue per life license
- Points per license
- Persistency
- Chargebacks

## 🌐 Brand & Marketing
- OOC Unlimited is the brand (not GFI externally)
- "Mission before commission" tagline
- garylifeindex.com as recruiting hub
- /join page for prospects
- Social media presence via Amanda

## 🗓️ Key Dates
- May 23, 2026 — Gary's 44th birthday ($556K target)
- June 30, 2026 — EMD promotion target
- Dec 14, 2026 — Domain renewal (garylifeindex.com)

## Priority Order
1. **Recruiting** — volume, volume, volume
2. **Sales** — close your own deals
3. **Scale** — retention, duplicatable systems, agent stick rate
