## 🎯 ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GARY

### Immediate Actions (Tonight/Tomorrow):
1. **Sign up for Insurance Sales Lab** ($200-300/month) — Most bang for buck. Enroll agents in their daily role-play + weekly coaching calls. Life insurance masterclass by David Porter is perfect.
2. **Contact Insurance Pro Shop** — Request info on their 90-day coaching program. Life insurance + annuities focus = perfect fit for IUL sales.
3. **Schedule free call with Permission Group** — See if their 1-on-1 model can work for onboarding new recruits.

### Short-term (This Week):
4. **Contact Jeremy Smith Academy** — His team development consulting could help build Gary's onboarding SYSTEM (not just train one agent at a time).
5. **Post on r/forhire and Upwork** — Write a job posting: "Seeking freelance insurance agent trainer for virtual onboarding. Must know life insurance/IUL sales, scripts, closing. Recurring contract. Zoom-based."
6. **Search Upwork directly** (in browser) for "insurance agent training" profiles

### Medium-term:
7. **Build internal system** — Use Insurance Sales Lab or similar as the foundation, then layer Gary's PROLIFIC-style training on top
8. **Find Susan Wright on Upwork** — Her credentials (CLU, ChFC) and experience writing training materials could be valuable

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

**The "freelance insurance onboarding trainer" as a standalone job title essentially doesn't exist.** This is an extremely niche role. What DOES exist:

1. **Insurance sales coaching companies** (Insurance Sales Lab, Insurance Pro Shop, Permission Group) — these are the closest match and most actionable
2. **Agency consulting firms** (Jeremy Smith Academy, Sitkins Group) — good for system-building
3. **YouTube educators** (David Duford, Cody Askins) — run their own agencies, not typically available for freelance work
4. **Upwork freelancers** — exist but in the "insurance operations" category, not "training"

**Best path forward:** Subscribe to a coaching platform (Insurance Sales Lab is cheapest + most comprehensive) and ALSO hire a consultant (Jeremy Smith or similar) to build Gary's custom onboarding system.
