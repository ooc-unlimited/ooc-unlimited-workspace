# Chief of Staff — OOC Unlimited / GFI

**Location:** Remote (Virtual Office on Zoom)  
**Type:** Contract — Part-Time to Full-Time  
**Industry:** Financial Services & Insurance  

---

## The Company

OOC Unlimited operates within GFI (Global Financial Impact), a financial services organization focused on life insurance, retirement planning, and income protection. We recruit, train, and develop licensed insurance agents — turning them into producers and future leaders.

We've built a proven onboarding framework (PROLIFIC) and invested heavily in automation. Our AI-powered Chief of Staff (Donna) handles pipeline tracking, automated communications, milestone alerts, and scheduling prompts. What we need now is the **human counterpart** — someone who can do the things AI can't: pick up the phone, run a live training session, read a room, and build real relationships with new agents.

## The Role

As Chief of Staff, you are the operational backbone of our agency. You work alongside AI automation to manage the full lifecycle of agent onboarding — from the moment someone signs their ICA through their first independent production.

This is not an assistant role. You own the operation.

## Responsibilities

### Pipeline Operations
- Manage all active recruits through our 11-stage onboarding pipeline
- Ensure every agent has a clear next step within 24 hours — no one goes dark on your watch
- Follow up with stalled or disengaged agents via phone and text
- Coordinate licensing exam scheduling with our licensing department (Karren)
- Pull and report weekly metrics: recruits, licenses, stick rate, points per recruit, net license ratio

### Live Training & Development
- Run Client Experience (CE) sessions on Zoom when leadership is unavailable
- Facilitate daily hands-on training (HOT) sessions — the 7 Fundamentals:
  - Phone calls, edification, conversation skills, answering questions, product knowledge, closing, and duplication
- Attend and support Monday PhoneZone sessions (8 PM EST)
- Coordinate field training between new agents, Certified Field Trainers (CFTs), and leadership

### Systems & Tools
- Ringy CRM — contact management, SMS sequences, pipeline tracking
- Tevah — back office, commission tracking, recruiting metrics
- Agency Rocket — webinars and comparison tools for client presentations
- Ethos — income protection policy applications
- iDecide — interactive presentations
- Zoom — daily Virtual Office, CE sessions, training
- Google Workspace — calendar, docs, communication

### Agent Relations
- Deliver the "Expect the Pushback" welcome process for every new recruit
- Be the first operational contact after sign-up — warm, professional, and direct
- Schedule all appointments between recruits, trainers, and leadership via Calendly
- Manage the 7-day engagement filter — identify who's doing the work and who isn't

## What We're Looking For

- **2+ years** in operations, recruiting coordination, or agency management in insurance or financial services
- **Strong phone presence** — you'll be calling recruits, running training, and re-engaging stalled agents
- **High-volume pipeline management experience** — you've kept complex processes running without dropping balls
- **Process discipline** — you follow systems, track everything, and flag problems early
- **Tech-savvy** — CRM platforms, Zoom, scheduling tools, Google Workspace
- **Available during EST business hours** + Monday evenings (8 PM PhoneZone)
- **Self-starter** — you see what needs doing and do it without being asked

## What Makes This Different

You're not starting from zero. The automation is built. The systems are documented. The framework exists. You're stepping into a machine that works and making it run faster and smoother — with the human touch that no automation can replace.

This is a growth-stage operation. The right person won't just fill a role — they'll grow into a leadership position as the team scales. If you want to be part of building something from the ground floor, this is it.

## To Apply

Send us:
1. A brief intro — who you are and why this role fits
2. Your experience managing recruiting or onboarding pipelines (include volume/scale)
3. A specific example of keeping a high-volume process from breaking down
4. Your availability: hours/week, time zone, and flexibility for evening sessions

*We're building something real. If you're the person who makes the machine run, let's talk.*
