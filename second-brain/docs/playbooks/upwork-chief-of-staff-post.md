# Chief of Staff — Insurance & Financial Services Agency (Remote)

## Job Description

We're a growing financial services and insurance agency (OOC Unlimited / GFI) looking for a **Chief of Staff** to run the day-to-day operations of our recruiting and agent onboarding pipeline. This is a hands-on leadership role — you'll be the operational engine that keeps our system running while our leadership focuses on recruiting and closing.

**Important context:** We already have AI-powered automation handling pipeline tracking, alerts, scheduling prompts, and communications. You're not building systems from scratch — you're the human operator who works alongside our automation to handle the things that require a real person: phone calls, live training sessions, relationship management, and judgment calls.

## What You'll Own

### Agent Onboarding & Pipeline Management
- Manage new recruits through our 11-stage onboarding pipeline from ICA submission through independent production
- Ensure no recruit waits more than 24 hours without a clear next step
- Follow up with stalled agents via phone, text, and email — re-engage or triage
- Coordinate licensing exam scheduling with our licensing department
- Track and report on pipeline metrics: recruits, licenses, stick rate, points per recruit

### Live Training & Sessions
- Run Client Experience (CE) sessions when leadership is unavailable
- Facilitate the "7 Fundamentals" hands-on training (HOT) — daily 20-60 minute sessions covering phone skills, edification, conversations, product knowledge, closing, and duplication
- Attend and support weekly PhoneZone sessions (Mondays, 8 PM EST)
- Coordinate field training schedules between new agents, Certified Field Trainers, and leadership

### CRM & Tools Management
- Manage Ringy CRM — update contact records, monitor SMS sequences, maintain pipeline stages
- Work within Tevah back office for commission tracking and recruiting metrics
- Use Agency Rocket, Ethos, iDecide, and Zoom as part of daily operations
- Keep all systems current and accurate

### Communication & Coordination
- Serve as the primary operational point of contact for new agents after sign-up
- Deliver the "Expect the Pushback" welcome process — setting expectations with new recruits about common pushback they'll receive
- Schedule appointments via Calendly between recruits, trainers, and leadership
- Coordinate with uplines and Certified Field Trainers for field training assignments

## Who You Are

- **2-4+ years in operations, recruiting coordination, or agency management** — ideally in insurance, financial services, or a similarly regulated industry
- **Comfortable on the phone** — a significant part of this role is calling recruits, following up, and running training sessions live
- **Relentlessly organized** — you manage high-volume pipelines without letting anyone fall through the cracks
- **Process-driven but adaptable** — you follow the system and flag when something needs to change
- **Tech-comfortable** — CRM tools, Zoom, Google Workspace, and scheduling platforms are second nature
- **Available EST business hours + Monday evenings** (8 PM PhoneZone)
- **Self-directed** — you don't wait to be told what's next; you see the gap and fill it

## Why This Role

This isn't a typical VA or admin gig. You'll be a true Chief of Staff — the person who makes the operation run. We're at a growth inflection point: the recruiting system works, the automation is built, and now we need the right human operator to scale it.

The right person will grow with the company. As we scale, this role scales with it — into team leadership, training program ownership, or operational management.

## To Apply

Tell us:
1. Your experience managing a recruiting or onboarding pipeline (volume and complexity)
2. A specific example of how you kept a high-volume process from breaking down
3. Your availability (hours/week, time zone, evening flexibility)

**Contract type:** Ongoing, part-time to full-time based on fit
