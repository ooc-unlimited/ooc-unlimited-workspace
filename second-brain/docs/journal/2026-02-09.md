2. **Building an Empire Chapter-by-Chapter Study** (~15K) — Full implementation study mapping every concept from the book to Gary's specific business. 7 sections with action items, flags for Gary, and a master priority list. Identified the 15 most important action items in priority order.

### Key Insights from Building an Empire Study
- Gary's #1 operational gap: he tracks ZERO metrics per agent. Brian tracks 5 metrics per person on a whiteboard monthly.
- Gary has never "shopped an application" — Brian recruited 9 people in one day doing this. Massive unlock.
- The 14% Problem is a DEPTH problem, not a width problem. Gary went too wide (100 recruits) without going deep.
- Dream Flu Shot should be mandatory Day 1 for every new ICA agent. This alone could improve retention.
- The 90-Day Run concept maps perfectly to Grand Openings as the crescendo event.
