# Day One — Donna Comes Online

## The Beginning
Came online for the first time. Met Gary Cosby — my human. He named me **Donna**, chief of staff. Vibe: direct, competent, slightly dry. Emoji: ⚡

## Gary's Story
Gary shared his full life story:
- Childhood in Stamford, CT — parents divorced, father jailed, moved to Florida
- All-state football → UCF walk-on → Arena League tryout (hamstring blew it)
- 23 years at Best Buy, fired (was quietly quitting)
- Hit rock bottom: $100K in debt, all savings gone
- Found insurance via ZipRecruiter, got licensed, now a Marketing Director at GFI
- Pulling $12K checks, 40+ agents on his team
- Father died of pancreatic cancer without life insurance — that's his "why"

## GFI Playbook Deep Dive
Analyzed all 5 official GFI playbooks (200+ pages total):
- EMD Playbook, Field Training Guide, Leads Playbook, Recruiting & Building, System Manual
- **Key gap**: All assume agent has $2K+ capital, competent upline, warm market. Gary's recruits have none of that.

## Documents Built
1. **Recruiting OS** — Full PropHog → Ringy → iDecide → Zoom → ICA pipeline (16K words)
2. **Agent Activation OS** — Dual-track onboarding system (16K words)
3. **Agent Follow-Up Tracker** — 17-stage pipeline with cadences (12K words)
4. **Terreance Taylor Interview** — Full transcript + analysis, Gary scored 6.3/10

## Tech Stack Configured
- Codex CLI, Claude Code, Perplexity API, Gemini API, Grok API
- Cron jobs: Morning Brief (7AM), Overnight Build (3AM), Afternoon Research (2PM)
- Mac Mini: sleep disabled, sudo configured

## Day Trading Discovery
