# The 7 Fundamentals

## What They Are
The seven core skills every new agent must master during Hands-On Training (HOT). These are practiced through role-play — "you say it, I say it" — until they become natural.

## The 7

### 1. Phone Call
How to pick up the phone and dial. Sounds basic — it's not. Most new agents freeze when it's time to actually call someone. Practice until it's muscle memory.

### 2. Edify
How to introduce your upline/mentor to a prospect. This is the warm handoff — making the expert sound like an expert so the prospect is ready to listen.

### 3. Conversation
Natural talk tracks, not scripts. How to have a real conversation about what you do without sounding like a telemarketer. Discovery, rapport, genuine curiosity.

### 4. Answer Questions
Handling objections with confidence. The top 4:
- "Don't want to pay $199"
- "Where do leads come from?"
- "Don't want to build a team, just want to produce"
- "Compensation is too low"

### 5. Product Knowledge
What you're actually selling. Understanding the products well enough to explain them simply and match them to client needs.

### 6. Clo"Z"ing
Getting the commitment. Not pressure tactics — confident, direct asks. "Based on what we discussed, which option makes the most sense for your family?"

### 7. Duplication
Teaching others to do what you do. This is what separates agents from builders. Can you teach someone else all 7 of these fundamentals?

## How HOT Works
- Run by Gary or CFTs (Certified Field Trainers)
- 20 minutes to 1 hour daily
- Pure role-play: "You say it, I say it"
- No real clients until fundamentals are solid
- Number of sessions before independence varies per person

## Why This Order Matters
Phone call is first because it's the gateway — everything else is useless if you can't pick up the phone. Duplication is last because you need all 6 others before you can teach them.
