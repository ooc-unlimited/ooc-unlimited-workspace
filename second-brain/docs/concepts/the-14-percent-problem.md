# The 14% Problem

Of 70 ICA'd agents in Ringy, only 10 (14%) ever received a phone call.

That means 60 people:
1. Were found on PropHog
2. Responded to SMS
3. Had a conversation
4. Were interested enough to sign an ICA
5. **And then heard nothing.**

This isn't a recruiting problem. Gary can recruit. The pipeline proof is right there — 70 signed agreements. The problem is what happens after.

## Root Cause
- No structured post-ICA follow-up cadence
- No handoff to onboarding
- Relying on the agent to self-start (they won't — they don't know how)
- Gary's time is split between recruiting new and activating existing

## The Fix
The Agent Activation OS + Follow-Up Tracker close this gap. Every agent gets:
- A call within 24 hours of ICA
- Onboarding 1 within 48 hours
- A clear 10-14 day path to first client

**The fastest way to grow Gary's income is not recruiting more agents. It's activating the ones he already has.**
