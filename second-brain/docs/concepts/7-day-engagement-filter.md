# 7-Day Engagement Filter

## What It Is
A binary check applied 7 days after an agent's ICA (Independent Contractor Agreement) submission. Determines if the agent should stay in active pipeline or be deprioritized.

## The Test
**Engaged = YES if any of these are true:**
- Listened to some of "Building an Empire" audiobook
- Booked or attended CE Part 1
- Responsive to texts/calls

**Not Engaged = YES if ALL of these are true:**
- No homework done (audiobook untouched)
- No CE Part 1 booked
- Ghosting texts

## What Happens
- **Engaged**: Continue active pipeline, invest time and energy
- **Not Engaged**: Deprioritize (DON'T mute) — match with someone else, move to nurture status

## Why 7 Days
- Short enough to catch disengagement early before wasting weeks
- Long enough to allow for life getting in the way
- Building an Empire audiobook is ~7 hours — listening to "some" in 7 days is very achievable
- If someone can't engage at ALL in 7 days, they're unlikely to build

## Philosophy
> "Don't mute them — they might come back. But don't chase people who aren't chasing their dreams." — Gary

## Origin
Concept from Anthony's onboarding techniques (GFI system), adapted by Gary for his licensed-agent pipeline. Book assignment serves double duty: education AND engagement filter.
