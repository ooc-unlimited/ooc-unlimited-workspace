# Best Loser Wins

## The Core Truth

This is the foundation. Everything else sits on top of this.

Tom Hougaard wrote *Best Loser Wins* and it changed how I think about trading completely. Here's the study that broke my brain: FXCM analyzed **43 million trades** across their platform. Traders had a **61% win rate**. Sixty-one percent. And they still lost money overall.

How? Average winning trade: **48 pips**. Average losing trade: **83 pips**. They were right more than half the time and still went broke. The math is brutal and simple — being right doesn't matter if your losses dwarf your wins.

## The Job

The job isn't to be right. The job is to **lose well**. Cut losers fast, let winners run. That's it. That's the whole game. Every trader knows this intellectually. Almost nobody does it because their emotions won't let them.

This is why Hougaard focuses on psychology over strategy. The strategy is maybe 20% of the game. The other 80% is whether you can execute it without your ego, fear, and hope destroying you.

## The Hierarchy

Think of it like GFI and Papa Kapp:

- **Best Loser Wins = the values layer.** This is the WHY. The philosophy. The soul of how I trade. Same way Papa Kapp's vision is the soul of GFI.
- **Hougaard's setups (H1 Scalp, School Run, etc.) = the operational layer.** This is the HOW. The daily execution. Same way the GFI system is how we operate day-to-day.

You can't run the setups without the philosophy. The setups are just entries and exits. BLW is what keeps you in the chair when you take three losses in a row.

## The 3 Commands

Before every single trade, say these out loud:
1. I accept the risk
2. I don't need this trade to work
3. I am prepared to lose this money

These aren't affirmations. They're psychological armor. See [The 3 Commands](the-3-commands.md) for the deep dive.

## Key Takeaways

- Win rate means nothing without proper risk management
- Your job is to lose small, not win big
- Psychology > strategy, every single time
- BLW is the trading soul — everything else is execution
