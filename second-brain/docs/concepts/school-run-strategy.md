# School Run Strategy

## The Setup

Hougaard calls it the School Run because it happens at 3:00–3:30 PM ET — right when parents are picking up kids from school. The market knows most retail traders are distracted or done for the day. That's when the games begin.

## What Happens

Market makers need to fill orders before the 4:00 PM close. To do that, they need liquidity. Where's the liquidity? **Sitting behind stop losses.**

So they push price hard in one direction — spiking through obvious support or resistance — to trigger a wave of stops. That creates the liquidity they need. Once they've filled their orders, price reverses.

This is a **fade setup**. You're trading against the spike, not with it.

## How It Works

1. **Watch the 3:00–3:30 PM window.** Look for a sharp, aggressive move in one direction.
2. **Wait for the spike to exhaust.** Don't jump in front of it. Let it finish.
3. **Enter counter-trend.** If price spiked up, go short. If it spiked down, go long.
4. **Tight stop above/below the spike high/low.** If you're wrong, you're out fast. The spike shouldn't get exceeded if the fade is real.
5. **Target a return toward the pre-spike price.** You're not looking for a massive move — just the reversion.

## My Rules

- **Don't anticipate the spike.** Wait for it to happen, then react. Trying to predict which direction they'll push is a losing game.
- **Confirm with volume.** The spike should come on a volume surge. If price drifts quietly, it's not a School Run setup.
- **Respect the clock.** If the spike hasn't happened by 3:30, it's probably not coming. Move on.
- **Small size.** This is an end-of-day trade with limited time for it to work. Position accordingly.

## Key Takeaways

- 3:00–3:30 PM is the window — market makers hunting stops before the close
- Fade the spike, don't chase it
- Tight stop above/below the extreme — if it breaks, you're wrong
- Patience is everything — wait for the move, then react
