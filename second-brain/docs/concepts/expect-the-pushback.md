# Expect the Pushback

## What It Is
The "inoculation email" sent to every new agent within 1 hour of their ICA + $199 payment. Named by Gary on Feb 10, 2026 — originally called "Dream Flu Shot."

## Purpose
Prepare new agents for the inevitable negative reactions they'll get from friends/family when they announce they've joined a financial services career. Like a flu shot — a small dose of reality now so the full virus can't knock them out later.

## Why It Matters
Most agent churn happens in the first 7 days. The #1 killer isn't lack of training — it's a well-meaning friend or family member saying "Is that a pyramid scheme?" before the agent has context to respond. This email gives them that context BEFORE the pushback arrives.

## Contains
1. **Inoculation content** — what pushback to expect, why people react that way, the numbers behind the business
2. **Building an Empire audiobook link** — homework assignment, also serves as 7-day engagement filter
3. **Calendly link** — book CE Part 1 training session

## Key Quotes (from the email)
> "Would you let someone who's never been to a restaurant review the food?"

> "The people who succeed aren't special — they just didn't stop when someone told them no."

## Origin
Concept inspired by Brian Carruthers' "Building an Empire" — the idea that you must inoculate new recruits against negativity before it reaches them. Gary's version adds his personal story (father's death, being broke, the $12K check) as proof that the business works.
