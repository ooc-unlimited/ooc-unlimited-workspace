# The 3 Commands

## The Pre-Trade Ritual

Before every single trade, say these three statements out loud. Not in your head. **Out loud.** This is non-negotiable.

### Command 1: "I accept the risk."

You're about to risk real money (or paper money that represents real money). Most traders enter a trade and then panic when it goes against them — as if losing was a surprise. It's not a surprise. It's a statistical certainty that some trades will lose.

Saying "I accept the risk" means: I know my stop is at 12.5 points. I know I could lose that amount. I'm choosing to take this trade anyway because the setup is valid. No surprises.

### Command 2: "I don't need this trade to work."

This one kills **desperation**. The moment you need a trade to work, you've already lost. You'll move your stop. You'll add to a loser. You'll watch a 12.5 point loss become a 50 point loss because you couldn't accept being wrong.

No single trade matters. There are infinite setups. If this one doesn't work, there will be another one tomorrow. And the day after. Abundance mentality — same thing I preach in recruiting. If this agent doesn't stick, the next one will.

### Command 3: "I am prepared to lose this money."

This is the final gate. Are you actually okay losing this money? If the answer is no — if losing this amount would ruin your day, stress you out, or make you emotional — **you're sized too big**. Reduce your position until you can honestly say this and mean it.

## Why This Works

These three commands eliminate the three emotions that destroy traders:

1. **Fear** → "I accept the risk" removes it. You chose this.
2. **Hope** → "I don't need this trade to work" kills it. You're detached.
3. **Attachment** → "I am prepared to lose this money" dissolves it. The money is already gone.

What's left is a clear, calm mind that can execute the plan without interference.

## How I Use It

Every trade. Every time. No exceptions. I say them out loud before I click the button. It takes 10 seconds and it's the most important 10 seconds of the trade. The entry, the stop, the target — that's mechanical. The 3 Commands are what make me capable of following through.

## Key Takeaways

- Say all three commands **out loud** before every entry
- They eliminate fear, hope, and attachment — the three account killers
- If you can't honestly say Command 3, you're sized too big
- 10 seconds that determine whether you execute or self-destruct
