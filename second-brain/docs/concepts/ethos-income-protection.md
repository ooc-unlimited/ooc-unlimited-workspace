# Ethos — Income Protection

## What It Is
Digital life insurance platform used to close an income protection policy on new agents during CE Part 1 — before they hang up from the first training session.

## Why We Use It
1. **Internal consumption** — agent experiences the product they'll be selling
2. **Immediate value** — agent walks away from CE Part 1 with actual coverage
3. **Commitment deepener** — they've now bought in, not just paid $199
4. **Story fuel** — "I got my own policy on Day 1" becomes a recruiting tool

## When in the Pipeline
- **CE Part 1**, final step (after Onboarding 1 slides → Agency Rocket webinar → Tevah PFR)
- Done BEFORE hanging up from the Zoom call
- Gary walks them through it live

## Notes
- New tool in Gary's stack (added Feb 10, 2026)
- Replaces whatever was previously used for internal consumption close
- Digital-first = fast, no paper, agent gets coverage immediately
