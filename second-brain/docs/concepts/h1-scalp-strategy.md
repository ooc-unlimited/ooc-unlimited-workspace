# H1 Scalp Strategy

## The Setup

Hougaard's H1 Scalp is built on one observation: the first 60 minutes of the New York session (9:30–10:30 AM ET) establishes a range. Once that range breaks, price tends to run.

The logic is simple. The open is chaotic — overnight orders filling, institutions positioning, retail jumping in. All that noise creates a range. When one side wins and price breaks out, the losers get squeezed and the move accelerates.

## How It Works

1. **Wait for the first 60 minutes to complete.** Don't trade during this window. Just watch.
2. **Mark the high and low of that range.** These are your breakout levels.
3. **Trade the breakout.** Long above the high, short below the low.
4. **Set your stop and target.** My rules: **12.5 point stop, 25 point target**. That's a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio. Exactly what BLW teaches — small losses, bigger wins.

## My Rules

- Only take the trade if NQ has **clear direction**. If the range is tight and choppy with no conviction, skip it. Not every day gives you an H1.
- One shot per day. If the breakout fails, don't re-enter. The setup is done.
- Check VWAP bias first. If price breaks out above the H1 range AND is above VWAP, that's confluence. Take it with confidence.
- If it breaks below the range but VWAP is above, be cautious. Conflicting signals = smaller size or no trade.

## First Paper Trade

My first paper trade using this setup: **+16.25 points on NQ**. Not a home run, but a clean execution. Entry was clear, stop was set, I let it work. Didn't chase, didn't panic. That's the whole point — the process, not the P&L.

## Key Takeaways

- Let the first 60 minutes form the range — patience is the edge
- 12.5pt stop / 25pt target — always 2:1 minimum
- Only trade clear breakouts with directional conviction
- One attempt per day — no revenge trading the H1
