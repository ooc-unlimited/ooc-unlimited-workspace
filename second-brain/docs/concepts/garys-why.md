# Gary's Why

Gary's father died of pancreatic cancer without life insurance. His sister cared for him at the end, but it could have been better — with a policy, Gary believes his father might still be here.

Gary himself was that guy: broke, laid off from Best Buy after 23 years, $100K in debt, zero warm market. Found insurance on ZipRecruiter. Nobody trained him. Nobody showed him anything. He almost quit multiple times.

Now he's a Marketing Director pulling $12K checks.

**His mission:** Help the person he was. The broke, lost guy who stumbled into insurance with no support. Not just recruiting — *rescuing*.

The industry works. The onboarding is broken. Gary's system exists to fix that gap.

This isn't a business strategy. It's personal.
