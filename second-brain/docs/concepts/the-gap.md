# The Gap

GFI's official playbooks assume every new agent has:
- $2,000+ in capital for leads
- A competent, available upline
- Experience with CRM and dialers
- A warm market of 100+ contacts

Gary's recruits — cold-sourced licensed agents from PropHog — have **none of that**.

They're people like Gary was: broke, no warm market, no mentor, figuring it out alone. The official system isn't wrong — it's just built for a different person.

**Gary's edge** is building the bridge between "licensed and lost" and "producing and growing." That's the entire mission: compress the timeline from years to weeks.

## The Fix
- **Agent Activation OS**: Dual-track onboarding that accounts for zero warm market
- **Recruiting OS**: Cold pipeline (PropHog → Ringy → iDecide → Zoom → ICA) that replaces warm market recruiting
- **Follow-Up Tracker**: Stage-by-stage accountability so nobody falls through the cracks

The gap isn't a weakness — it's Gary's competitive advantage. Nobody else is solving for this population.
