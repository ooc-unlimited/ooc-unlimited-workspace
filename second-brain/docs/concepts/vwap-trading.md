# VWAP Trading

## What Is VWAP?

Volume Weighted Average Price. It's the average price of an instrument weighted by volume throughout the trading day. Think of it as the "fair value" price — where the most business actually got done.

## Why It Matters

Institutional traders — the big money — use VWAP as their benchmark. When a fund needs to buy 10,000 contracts of NQ, they're measured against VWAP. Did they get a better price or worse? This means VWAP isn't just an indicator. It's where the real money is playing.

That makes it a **magnet**. Price gets pulled toward VWAP throughout the day like gravity. When price deviates too far, it snaps back. Mean reversion. This is the edge.

## How I Use It for NQ

Simple framework:

- **Price above VWAP** = bullish bias. I'm looking for longs, not fighting the flow.
- **Price below VWAP** = bearish bias. Looking for shorts.
- **Price testing VWAP** = this is where the best setups happen. VWAP acts as support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends.

The best trades come when price pulls back TO VWAP and bounces. That's the institution buying at fair value. I want to be on the same side as them.

## Rules

1. **Don't trade against VWAP bias.** If price is above VWAP, don't short unless you have a very specific reason.
2. **VWAP tests are high-probability entries.** Watch for price to touch VWAP and show rejection (wick, quick bounce).
3. **VWAP resets daily.** Yesterday's VWAP doesn't matter. Fresh day, fresh level.
4. **Combine with other setups.** VWAP alone isn't a strategy. It's a bias filter. Pair it with H1 Scalp or School Run for entries.
5. **Respect the deviation.** When price is 50+ points from VWAP on NQ, expect a pullback.

## Key Takeaways

- VWAP = institutional fair value, not just another line on the chart
- Use it as a directional bias filter, not a standalone signal
- Best entries happen at VWAP tests with clear rejection
- Always know where VWAP is before entering any trade
