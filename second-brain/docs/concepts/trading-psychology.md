# Trading Psychology

## Why 95% Fail

It's not the strategy. Every profitable strategy is available for free on YouTube. The information isn't the edge. **You** are the edge — or the problem.

95% of traders lose money not because they can't find good setups, but because they can't execute them consistently. They move stops. They chase entries. They revenge trade after a loss. They size up when they're emotional. They cut winners early and let losers run. Every single one of these is a **psychological failure**, not a technical one.

## The Mirror Principle

Hougaard teaches that the market is a mirror. It reflects your psychological state back at you in the form of your P&L.

If you're afraid, you'll take profits too early and miss the big moves. If you're greedy, you'll hold losers hoping they come back. If you're desperate, you'll overtrade and bleed out on commissions and bad entries. If you're disciplined, calm, and detached — your results will reflect that too.

Your account balance is a scorecard of your mental state. Period.

## Radical Accountability

This is Hougaard's approach and it's non-negotiable:

- **No blame.** The market didn't screw you. Your broker didn't hunt your stop. The algorithm didn't target you specifically.
- **No excuses.** "I should have..." means nothing. What did you actually do?
- **Every loss is tuition.** You paid for a lesson. Did you learn it? If you take the same loss twice for the same reason, you wasted the first payment.

This is identical to how I think about recruiting. When an agent quits, I don't blame them. I ask what I could've done better. Same energy.

## The Goal

The goal is **consistency**, not being right. I want to take the same trades, the same way, every single day. Process over outcome. If I follow my rules and lose, that's a good trade. If I break my rules and win, that's a bad trade.

## Key Takeaways

- Strategy is 20% of the game — psychology is the other 80%
- The market mirrors your mental state through your P&L
- Radical accountability: no blame, no excuses, every loss is tuition
- Consistency of process beats chasing wins
