## Re-Engagement Script (For Hot & Warm Agents)

### For agents contacted < 3 months ago:
> Hey [Name], it's Gary. We connected a while back about joining my team. I've been putting some things together and wanted to circle back — are you still in the insurance game? 🤙

### For agents contacted 3-6 months ago:
> Hey [Name], Gary Cosby here. I know it's been a minute — just wanted to check in. A lot has changed on our end and I think you'd be impressed. Got 5 minutes this week?

### For agents contacted 6+ months ago:
> [Name] — long time. It's Gary. Honestly, I should have followed up sooner. If you're still licensed and looking for the right team, I'd love to have that conversation. If not, no worries at all. Hope you're doing well.

## Key Insight

**Of 70 ICA'd agents, only 10 (14%) ever received a phone call.** That means 60 people signed an ICA — showed real interest — and were never called. This isn't a recruiting problem. It's a follow-through problem. The fix is straightforward: call people.
