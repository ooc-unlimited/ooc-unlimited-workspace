## What Gary Actually Does (vs. What's Automated)

### 🤖 Automated (Donna + System)
- Welcome text via Ringy
- "Expect the Pushback" email with audiobook + Calendly
- Status tracking across all 11 stages
- Follow-up texts at each milestone
- 24-hour stall alerts
- 7-day engagement filter
- Reminder texts before each session
- Pipeline reporting

### 👨‍💼 Gary Does (manual, high-value)
- CE Part 1 — live Zoom (60-90 min)
- CE Part 2 — live Zoom (review numbers, close business)
- HOT sessions (or delegate to CFTs) — 20 min to 1 hour daily
- Field training appointments — real exposure with sidelines
- PhoneZones — Mondays 8 PM EST
- Final judgment calls on engagement/deprioritization

## Key Tools by Stage

| Stage | Tools Used |
|-------|-----------|
| ICA | Payment platform → Donna detection |
| Welcome | **Ringy** (SMS) |
| Expect the Pushback | **Gmail** (email) + **Google Drive** (audiobook) + **Calendly** (booking) |
| CE Part 1 | **Zoom** + **Onboarding 1 slides** + **Agency Rocket** (webinar) + **Tevah** (PFR) + **Ethos** (income protection) |
| CE Part 2 | **Zoom** + **Agency Rocket** (comparison tool) + close internal consumption |
| HOT | **Zoom** or in-person, 7 Fundamentals practice |
| Field Training | **Zoom** or in-person, real appointments |
| PhoneZones | **Zoom**, Mondays 8 PM EST |

## The 7 Fundamentals (HOT Sessions)

1. **Phone call** — how to pick up the phone and dial
2. **Edify** — how to introduce your upline/mentor
3. **Conversation** — natural talk tracks, not scripts
4. **Answer questions** — handling objections with confidence
5. **Product knowledge** — what you're actually selling
6. **Clo"Z"ing** — getting the commitment
7. **Duplication** — teaching others to do what you do

*"You say it, I say it"* — role play until it's natural.

## Path A vs Path B (CE Part 1)

### Path A: NOT Licensed
- Study prep → licensing department (Karren) → exam → then onboarding slides

### Path B: Already Licensed (Gary's typical recruit)
- Straight to Onboarding 1 slides → Agency Rocket webinar → Tevah PFR → Ethos close

## Critical Metrics

- **ICA → CE Part 1**: <48 hours (momentum kills skepticism)
- **CE Part 1 → CE Part 2**: <48 hours
- **7-Day Engagement**: Did homework? Booked CE Part 1?
- **First sale**: <90 days target
- **Stick rate**: Currently ~5-10%. This system aims for 25%+.

## Gary's Philosophy

> "The faster I get people to exposures, the less skepticism they have."

> "The onboarding experience IS the retention strategy. If you lose them in the first 7 days, you never had them."
