# PhoneZone Tracker

## Schedule
**Every Monday, 8:00 PM EST** — Zoom call

## What It Is
Weekly group phone session where agents practice real calls together. Gary runs it. Agents at Stage 9+ (HOT In Progress or later) should attend.

## Format
1. Brief check-in (5 min) — wins from the week, who's got appointments
2. Live calls — agents make real calls with Gary/team listening
3. Coaching between calls — what worked, what to adjust
4. Accountability — who's hitting their numbers, who needs help

## Attendance Tracking
