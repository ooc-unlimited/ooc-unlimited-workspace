# 💉 Your Expect the Pushback
### What to Expect When You Join Gary's Team

Hey — welcome to the team. I'm genuinely excited you're here. But before we get rolling, I need to give you something important: the truth about what's coming.

Think of this as a flu shot. A little dose of reality now so the full virus can't knock you out later.

## What's Going to Happen

**In your first week**, you're going to be on fire. You'll think: *"This is a no-brainer. Everyone I know should do this."*

Then you'll call your first 10 people. And 8 of them will say no.

Some will say it nicely. Some won't. Your cousin might laugh. Your best friend might ghost you. Someone you respect might say *"Is that a pyramid scheme?"*

**This is normal.** This happens to every single person who's ever built anything in this industry — including me. Including the people making $50K/month.

## Why People Say No

They're not rejecting YOU. They're rejecting what they don't understand.

- They've never seen the full picture
- They've heard one negative story and decided that's the whole truth
- They're scared to try something new
- They're projecting their own fear of failure onto you

**Would you let someone who's never watched a movie review it for you?** That's what's happening when people judge your business without seeing the presentation.

## The Numbers (This Is Important)

Here's the reality of this business:

- **Out of every 10 people you talk to**: 2-3 will look at the presentation
- **Out of every 10 who see the presentation**: 3-5 will join
- **Out of every 10 who join**: 1-2 will actually build

This means for every 100 people you reach out to, you might find 1-2 builders. **That's the game.** And that's EXACTLY the same ratio in real estate, car sales, and every other sales profession.

The people who succeed? They just talk to more people than the people who quit.

## What I Need From You

1. **Don't explain the business yourself.** You're new. You don't have to be the expert. That's what I'm here for. Get your contacts in front of the presentation (iDecide) or on a call with me.

2. **Give me your top 10.** I'm going to call your sharpest contacts personally. Not to sell them — to share what we're building and see if they're open.

3. **Stay in communication.** Call me. Text me. Don't go silent. Silence is where businesses die.

4. **Do something every day.** Even one text, one call, one conversation. Momentum is a muscle.

5. **Protect your mindset.** The naysayers are coming. They always do. When it happens, call me BEFORE you let their words settle in.

## What You Can Expect From Me

- I will answer your calls
- I will help you close your prospects
- I will celebrate every single win, no matter how small
- I will be honest with you — even when it's not what you want to hear
- I will NEVER ask you to do something I'm not willing to do myself

## The Timeline

- **Day 1-3**: Welcome calls, game plan, make your list
- **Day 3-5**: First presentation (iDecide) with your best prospect
- **Day 7**: You should have your first recruit or be very close
- **Day 30**: You should be seeing real momentum
- **Day 90**: Your income story starts to become compelling

## One Last Thing

My father died of pancreatic cancer. He didn't have life insurance. His end didn't have to be that way.

I'm in this business because the person I was 2 years ago — broke, fired from a 23-year job, $100K in debt — needed someone to show him the way. Nobody did. I had to figure it out alone.

I'm not going to let that happen to you.

You made a decision today. A real one. Now let's go make it worth something.

— Gary
