## Transcript

**Gary:** There he goes. How are you?

**Terreance:** Good. Good.

**Gary:** You got to get your IT woman on there.

**Terreance:** Yeah.

**Gary:** Nice. How are doing today, sir?

**Terreance:** Good.

**Gary:** I'm doing good. Doing good. What do you guys got going on tomorrow? Not much.

**Terreance:** Going to sit around the house and eat. Yes, sir.

**Gary:** Yes, sir. Are you the cook? Nah, not this time.

**Terreance:** Nah. Nah, I'm the taste test guy. Taste test. Yes, sir.

**Gary:** Alrighty. Let's get into it. Where's my notepad?

**Terreance:** Okay.

**Gary:** So you watched the overview. You have any questions for me?

**Terreance:** Not any specific questions. I will say that I'm very, very new to the industry. I really don't have a whole lot of questions because I don't know what I don't know.

**Gary:** How new is new?

**Terreance:** I just got my license about a couple of weeks ago.

**Gary:** And what caused you to get your license? What made you say, okay, I want to do this?

**Terreance:** Well, I had already, I mean, I retired from the Army. And I kind of, I mean, I really enjoy doing things for people and helping people. You know, and at that time, you know, God blessed me with, you know, the career that I had. And, you know, and, but, you know, I was an infantry soldier, you know, as a young man's game, you know, and now I still want to help somebody and help people. Now I want. I do it without getting shot at or being hot, you know, or being cold or hungry and, you know, weight it down and that kind of thing. You know, I just don't have my body can't do that anymore at 51 years old. So I figured this would be the best, the best situation here for me because I do, I am looking. I am looking for the income, but I'm also looking for, I'm also looking for it to be righteous, you know, I mean, I, in order, you know, to actually be able to help somebody and then make a living at it, it's kind of what interests me.

**Gary:** Gotcha. Understood. Okay, nice. All right, so you have no questions, look, let me get started. And you were full-time, Armin? Yeah.

**Terreance:** All right. All right.

**Gary:** Thank you for your service. Thank you.

**Terreance:** Okay.

**Gary:** All right. Well, if you don't have any questions, I got a couple myself here.

**Terreance:** All right.

**Gary:** So, I mean, you kind of answered this already, but, you know, in your next venture, be it, you know, full-time, part-time on the side, what's important to you? Is it making more money, growing professionally and personally? Are you looking to have more time with your family, be on a winning team? Like, what's important to you?

**Terreance:** The most important thing to me is to actually be happy with the job. And because, you know, as long as you are, you know, happy with your job and you appreciate your job, a man will do a much better job. You know? Go ahead. The most important thing to me is liking where I'm at. You know, if you like where you are. You'll eventually do well enough to survive. If you like it, you're going to do a good job at it, you know?

**Gary:** And what does happy at your job mean? Go in a little detail with that.

**Terreance:** To me, if you're that guy that gets up in the morning, hit the snooze button 10 times, you know, and finally drag your butt up out of bed, you know, vice versa. You know, somebody that's got something to go after, you know? Somebody that's got some ambition, you know, to move up in life. I've got some pretty ambitious plans as far as leaving some generational wealth to my kids and grandkids. And in order to create that path of generational wealth, I need a stream of income that will support the investments.

**Gary:** Understood. All right. And if we can help you achieve those goals sooner rather than later, and it didn't interfere with what you do now, you know, it made sense personally, professionally, financially, how serious would you take it?

**Terreance:** I'm ready to jump in with both feet as long as I can jump in somewhere where I can get the, I need the proper leadership. You know, I need guidance. I need, you know, whoever I'm working with to understand that I am new to the industry. You know, so there's a lot of terminology and a lot of unspoken and things like that that I'm not aware of yet.

**Gary:** Understood. I mean, so obviously we're in the financial industry, highest compensated industry in the world, you know, so if we were to move forward with you and, you know, you got to a place where you can be financially free and you can get that generational wealth to your children's children, what does life look like for you? And is there someone that means the world to you that you would want to help?

**Terreance:** Yeah, I have grandchildren. I got kids of my own, too, but they're grown, you know?

**Gary:** So what does that look like? What does Financially Free look like? Are you doing it now, or what does that look like to you?

**Terreance:** Financially Free, is that what you're saying? Yep. Well, for a long, long time, I never had to look at my bank account before I bought something. I never had to wonder, hey, is this car going to go through this time? You know, is there enough money on this car? You know, I never had to deal with that. I've always made, you know, pretty good as far as income goes. Even when I was in the Army, I worked another job, you know? And, of course, you had to get permission to do that, but I mean, I worked two jobs for probably 10 years. You know, that's a lot of time away from my family, when you start looking at the ideology of trading time for money, you know, I don't want to trade time for money anymore. I would like to have money working while I sleep. And in order to do that, you know, you kind of have to have an income in order to create that foundation, you know, that platform that you're going to operate from.

**Gary:** Understood. Understood. But what, why is it a must? Like, why is it a big deal?

**Terreance:** Why is, which part of it?

**Gary:** Uh, that, that, that time, changing that time for money. Elaborate on that a little bit for me.

**Terreance:** Okay. Uh, trading time for money is, uh, that's the way you're going to stay poor. And once you can have your money working for you instead of working for it. Your work grows a lot faster.

**Gary:** Gotcha. Does your wife work?

**Terreance:** Yes.

**Gary:** All right. Nice. What does she do?

**Terreance:** She is also retired Army. And now she works for the IRS.

**Gary:** Are you, I mean, I know she's your IT person. Are you laptop-ish? Like, could you get on the Zoom or get on the Google Meet, you know?

**Terreance:** The problem is our computer, not the... The biggest problem, what it was yesterday is that the camera wouldn't commit. And it said on there that I needed to be on camera. So we tried and tried and tried and tried, and every time I got the camera installed, it would uninstall a few minutes later. You know, it's some kind of, and we kind of... We live a little bit out, you know, in the county. So sometimes, you know, your internet can be a little sketchy, but we're assuming that it's got something to do with what's going on in our area right here because we're not the only ones having problems. We have a Facebook page for our neighborhood, and apparently there's everybody else having problems, too. So I'm almost sure that it was a technical problem on this end.

**Gary:** All right. Got you. All right. So what type of annual income would you need to support that? What are you looking to do annually?

**Terreance:** Annually? I'd like to make, you know, the low six figures, I guess, between January to January. I'd like to make, you know, low six figures or, you know, close to it.

**Gary:** Very doable. Yep. Absolutely. And how long have you been retired for the military? I'm sorry. I don't remember you saying that.

**Terreance:** 2017.

**Gary:** All right. And have you been doing anything in between?

**Terreance:** I went to school. I went back to school after I retired. I became a nurse. Being a combat medic, I thought nursing would be something that, you know, I would fall into, you know. Well, after working the job, you know, that year, it wasn't what I was looking for, you know. And one of my issues with the military is I had a lot of jobs that I did not want. A lot of times I did not want to be in the military. So I don't want another job where I get up and I dread going to work. You know what mean? I want to be, I'm that guy that I planned my day before, you know, I planned my day the night before. You know what I'm saying? I jump up and hit the ground running. You know, if you don't hit the ground. I wrote it when you wake up, you're burning time. Time is the one thing you can't get back. I can always get more money. I can never make more time. A hundred percent.

**Gary:** A hundred percent. Yeah. And nurses tend to do well here because they have the stories, you know, most of what we do is storytelling. And I'm pretty sure you've seen a lot, you know, especially just even within those few years from 2017 till now. So, yeah, no, that's good stuff. Why did, with the army, I mean, I've seen movies, you know, I'm not in the army. My uncle was army, but did they gear you, steer you towards being a medic or did you, is that something you wanted to do?

**Terreance:** What happened with that situation is I was originally in the Navy my first four years. And that's where I became a corpsman, which is a medic. The medics that the Marine Corps gets, they get from us, from the Navy. The Marine Corps doesn't train medics, so they always have a corpsman with them, and I wound up in that job because while I was in school, somebody came in and said, hey, who knows how to shoot? And I raised my hand, you know, and he'd come with us, you know, and so I wound up in that type of work, you know, just, I just fell into it. More or less, and I enjoyed it, you know, but the nursing side of the house to me was, it was a lot less engaging. You know, with me, it was plugging bullet holes under fire, you know, putting tourniquets on under fire, you know, things like that, and nursing didn't have that edge that it gave me. I mean, it was, I went from, you know, like I said, patching buttholes and stuff to passing out pills, you know, some 80-year-old guy that nobody comes to see who's on life support and about to die anyway. I didn't like seeing that. You know what mean?

**Gary:** And see, those are those stories I'm talking about, right? You have that. All right, so I mean, you know, fast forward, you know, we see that it's a good fit for us, you think it's a good fit for you, we can, you know, help you help families, earn an income, especially the one you're looking for in the next one to three years, you know, if it's professionally, personally, is there any reason you wouldn't be able to pass a background check?

**Terreance:** No, I just passed one a couple weeks ago. Yeah, see, I applied, I was going to go to work at another company, you know, right now. After I got my license, you know, we started working on that, but I think the issue there is, my biggest issue is the guy that I was working under, he, well, for one, he was younger than my kids, you know, and he didn't, I don't, he, I don't, like, he's a bad gentleman, I think that he's 22 years old, he never led anybody, he doesn't know what he's doing, so, I'll give you an example, he told me where to go in order to get, to take my test for the life insurance, and so he sends me to this site, I join it, and I get ready to start learning the material, so then he texts me and says, when you get to the section where you have to answer your questions, just go to Google Answer, and then have answer your question. Take that answer, put it in, and just pass the test, and then we'll teach you what you know. That, to me, that would shape, that, you know, if I gave that kind of instruction to a soldier, it would kill him. You know what I'm saying? So anyway, I passed the test, and I don't hear from anybody for a couple of weeks. And then he was like, the next day after I passed the test, he was like, call the state and find out what you can do to move your license along. And I was like, who the heck am I supposed to call at the state? What department am I calling? Do I have a point of contact, you know? It's just a blade text, you know? And that kind of stuff has gone on since I've tried to go to work for these people. So at this point, I don't feel like I can. I don't feel like I'm willing to put my effort and trust into these guys because, you know, so far what I've seen is stuff that I would not tolerate if I was running the show.

**Gary:** With them, do you know the term captive? Are you captive there?

**Terreance:** Okay. All right.

**Gary:** You know what company? What's the name of the company?

**Terreance:** They were North American Senior Investment, North American, yeah, North American Senior, North American Senior Investment.

**Gary:** Vaguely sounds familiar. North American Senior. Yeah.

**Terreance:** And then they had a subsidiary that was a Plan Right Financial.

**Gary:** Okay. I just got to check up on that because I want to make sure. Were you appointed with any of their carriers? What do you mean by appointed? So North American Senior, again, I'm not too familiar with them. I'll do some research when we get off. However they sell, be it a whole life, a term, IUL, or whatever their products are, were you appointed with the carriers? Were you able to sell their products?

**Terreance:** No, I haven't sold anything. Like I said, the process of getting onboarded has stalled badly. And, you know, it's like the one guy that's supposed to be my contact, you know, I don't expect you to answer me back in five minutes, but I do expect you to answer me back before 48 hours. You know, I just wait and wait. Like now, I'm in limbo waiting for somebody to call me and give me my next move. You know, so I don't feel like, I, that subpar performance is not worth what I'm willing to invest into somebody else. Until I can eventually be my own company and have my own agency. You know what I mean? Now we're talking. I don't do anything but grow. If you're not growing, you're going back. A hundred percent, a thousand percent.

**Gary:** All right. So, you know, just based off a couple of things that you told me, our trainings, we have 15 trainings a week. Even this Thanksgiving week, we have at least 13 of them. Don't have anything tomorrow, but we have four of them today. None of them are mandatory, you know, but I will have all the trainings posted and you can join which ones you like. Our onboarding is pretty structured. Onboard week one is you getting to learn the products and our company, you know, who we are, what we do. Onboarding two is, you know, starting to build out your agency, starting to get your board of directors together. And building out that agency and then onboarding three is going out and do some field. And making sure you're able to convey our message and also, you know, sell products and run illustrations and things like that. And then you're off to the races at that at that time, you'll never go more than 24 hours without being contacted with somebody or being communication with somebody. We have groups called Telegram. Ever heard that app Telegram?

**Terreance:** Yeah. Yeah. OK, perfect.

**Gary:** We have a group in there where we communicate. Bounce ideas off each other. It's real, you know, family, real family oriented in our group. There's also other divisions within our company. We have an armed forces division. I'm not in that, of course, because I'm not armed forces, but we have an armed forces division which you can plug into. We also have, you know, a faith based division. Our company's faith based. And that's we we have all faiths. You know, we don't really discriminate between any kind of faith. But if you can actually look at my background. Right. They did that on purpose where my pen is. That is actually a cross inside of our GFI there.

**Terreance:** And they did it purposely, you know, so it's because they don't want trouble with the ACLU.

**Gary:** You say that, but I mean, they're very open that we have faith. We have a faith division. You know, they pray at the end of their sessions. So, I mean, that's, you know, the kind of things we have to offer. So what next steps look like is you would fill out an independent contracting agreement with that. You remember on the overview about the one ninety nine. Did you see that one ninety nine?

**Terreance:** That is correct. I don't remember. I don't. It doesn't sound familiar.

**Gary:** OK, one ninety nine initial investment that goes over the background check. Get you your back office. Get you your agent code. It plugs you into the trainings, and you start off with a website. Have you ever heard of Ethos? Yeah.

**Terreance:** Okay.

**Gary:** You'll have an Ethos website, a QR code. You know what I mean by that, a QR code?

**Terreance:** Yeah.

**Gary:** So you'll have a website and a QR code which people can scan and get a policy on their own without an agent. They go onto Ethos and fill out the application and get approved and get a policy within 10 minutes. You'll have your own website with your name, your number. People can contact you that way. That comes with it, part of the plan. It's all baked in. It's a one-time investment, and it's not monthly or annual or anything like that.

**Terreance:** No problem.

**Gary:** So independent contractor agreement, whatever way you want me, I can either text it to you or email it to you. It's all done, you know, on the web. That $199 goes into escrow. Once that's done, I'll get your information to our executive, and then you'll meet with her. Her name is Lana, and then she'll go through and make sure that you're a good fit for us, we're a good fit for you, and then that's when the escrow will turn into, it'll be taken, and then we'll be off in the races. We'll start onboarding, so on and so forth, you know, if it's a good fit.

**Terreance:** All right. Do you have any questions? At this point, no. I mean, I looked at the video. You know, the GFI video, oh, I watched it a couple of times, you know, because I believe in saturation, saturation, you know what I mean, so, you know, this is, I'm very interested here, this is really looking good to me, and the reason what really is important to me is that flexibility, you know, because I have, like I said, I've got a pretty ambitious steps and with that being the case, I have several different irons in the fire to create a couple of different streams of income for investing and things like that. You know, I got a lot of irons in the fire. So having that flexibility to be able to say, oh, crap, I got to move this to this date so that I can take care of this, which is more important, you know, when you start prioritizing.

**Gary:** And our scheduling is based around your schedule. You know, we're kind of, you know, molded to, you know, when you're available.

**Terreance:** That's great. I mean, it's, you know, it ain't, it's not the time or the hours to put in, you know, that becomes the issue because I don't have any problem putting in the time. Lock in with no issues, you know. But, being a military person, time management is my Achilles tendon. I do not like people wasting time and I'm not gonna, I don't like sitting at idle. I don't like waiting on people to get back to me and things like that. I don't sit at idle. I like to go after stuff, you know?

**Gary:** All right, cool, cool. Okay. If you don't have any other questions, I'm going to, I guess I'll text it to you unless you want to, give you an email to give you the email, but I'll text it to you first. And then I'll have your, you can have your IT lady transfer it to your email if that's easier for you. But I, you should receive a text from me shortly there. I just posted that. So you should have that. And once that's filled out, like I said, I'll get your information over to the executive and can get things rolling.

**Terreance:** Sounds good. Sounds good.

**Gary:** Hey, Terrence. It was good meeting you today.

**Terreance:** You too, man. All right.

**Gary:** I hope to see you in the future. All right. Thanks.

**Terreance:** Thank you. Bye. Alright.
