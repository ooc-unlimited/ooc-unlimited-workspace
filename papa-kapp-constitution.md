# 📚 The Papa Kapp Constitution
### Gary Cosby's Values & Leadership Framework
*Distilled from "Building an Empire" by Brian Carruthers*

> This is not an operational manual. This is the moral compass. Every system, script, and process Gary builds must align with these principles. When in doubt, consult Papa Kapp.

## I. THE CORE BELIEFS

### 1. Recruiting Is The Answer (RITA)
- Every problem in the business is solved by recruiting more people
- Recruit everybody, then filter for coachability and fit
- "Your business needs new people just like a tree needs water from the ground"
- Cast the widest net possible — then select

### 2. The Fortune Is In The Follow-Up
- The initial "yes" or "no" is just the beginning
- Every day after a presentation without joining, odds drop ~10%
- Most people fail not because they can't recruit — they fail because they don't follow up
- "A database that has never been worked is one you might as well not have"

### 3. Phase One Forever
- Phase 1 = talking to prospects, making sales, recruiting
- Top earners NEVER stop doing Phase 1
- "Stay on the elevator" — the moment you stop doing what got you here, your team stops too
- "If my downline did what I did today, how much money would I be making?"

### 4. Massive Communication = Massive Income
- We are in the communication business, not the insurance business
- 75% of your time should be talking to prospects (yours or your team's)
- 25% is leadership/management
- "The size of your phone bill will determine the size of your check"

### 5. Speed Wins
- Compress time frames — 200 calls in 3 days, not 3 months
- "It is easier to build this business fast than slow"
- Gunpowder analogy: concentrated effort creates explosions
- The 90-day run: "90 days of pain for a lifetime of gain"

## II. LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES

### 6. Leaders Lead, Managers Manage — Be a Leader
- Managers get people to do what the company wants → short-lived compliance
- Leaders get people to WANT to do it themselves → lasting motivation
- Tune into their WIIFM (What's In It For Me)
- "If you try to manage your team, they will see that you're only looking out for your own goals"

### 7. Servant Leadership
- Put your people's needs FIRST
- Focus on building PEOPLE, not getting sales
- "Your goal should be to duplicate yourself"
- "The ultimate success is to have many people under you who out-earn you"

### 8. Inspect What You Expect
- Don't assume the system is running — go look
- Get in the trenches, work alongside your people
- Be a coach, not a boss
- "Only someone who wants to leave their financial future in their downline's hands would trust that everything is being done"

### 9. Positive Down, Negative Up
- NEVER spread negativity to your downline — it kills production
- Problems go upline ONLY
- "Never pee in your own swimming pool"
- Be the lifeguard who prevents others from doing it too

### 10. Recognition > Money
- "Babies cry for it and men die for it"
- Praise PROGRESS, not just results
- People will do more of what they get recognized for
- "If you praise every small win, you will inspire your team members to keep winning"

---

## III. THE MINDSET CODE

### 11. Act As If
- Carry yourself as if you're already at the top
- Confidence attracts — weakness repels
- "Nobody wants to follow a dud"
- BUT: confidence with humility, sincerity, and a servant's heart

### 12. Don't Drag Your Past Forward
- Every day is a new day. Every recruit is a new recruit.
- If your last 10 recruits quit, your next one doesn't know that
- "Positive expectancy is crucial — you must expect each recruit to win"
- What you project onto your recruits is what they will do

### 13. Get Pissed Off (Use It As Fuel)
- Let the doubters and naysayers fuel your fire
- "I let those remarks linger in my head as fuel"
- Channel anger into calls, into activity, into proving them wrong
- Gary's parallel: everyone who said insurance wouldn't work → $12K checks

### 14. The Shiny Object Is a Trap
- Pick your business. Stay the course. Stop looking left and right.
- "The countless jumpers I have known are often broke, desperate, and not living happy lives"
- "Would you let Wendy's talk you out of your McDonald's franchise?"
- Commitment + faith + confidence in your decision

### 15. Congruence: Actions Must Match Goals
- If your goals say $20K/month but your actions say 3 calls/week — you're lying to yourself
- "You can make excuses or you can make money, but you can't make both"
- Break the ice EARLY — 3-5 calls first thing every morning defeats call reluctance
- The marble jar: visualize activity transferring to dreams

---

## IV. BUILDING THE EMPIRE

### 16. Build Deep, Not Wide
- "Would you rather have 20 people making $500/month or 4 people making $5,000?"
- Depth creates fear of loss — people won't quit when they see action below them
- Taproot: recruit Mary → help Mary recruit John → help John recruit Tracy → keep going until you find a LEADER
- A leg is not solid until there are at least 3 leaders in a line

### 17. A Recruit Is Not a Recruit Until They've Recruited Someone
- The business goes from theory to reality with their first recruit
- Race is on: get them a win in the first 7 days
- "Grab their top 10" — call their sharpest contacts yourself
- Every day without success, their fire dies

### 18. Recruit THROUGH People, Not TO Them
- Don't get excited about the recruit — get excited about their contact list
- "Every dud knows a stud"
- They are a doorway to people you'd never have met
- "The only reason we want to recruit someone is so we can recruit everyone on their list"

### 19. Recruit to Invite (Not Invite to Recruit)
- Don't wait for Saturday's event to recruit — recruit NOW, then bring THEIR guests to Saturday
- "If you have a Thursday briefing and it's Monday, recruit Mon-Tue-Wed, invite THEIR contacts to Thursday"
- This turns 1 guest into 4-6 guests per event
- Production every day, not just event days

### 20. The 7-Day Window
- First 7 days after recruiting = CRITICAL
- Welcome calls (5-7 min each) with 2-3 upline members
- Game plan interview → make their list → book PBR/PCC within days
- "You do not have that much influence with your new recruit yet — use third-party validation"

---

## V. THE HUMAN GAME

### 21. Stop Selling, Start Solving
- Find their problem FIRST, then offer your solution
- "One mouth, two ears — listen twice as much as you talk"
- Let them sell themselves on the need
- "Customers who buy will stay customers longer than customers who were sold"

### 22. Be a Fisher, Not a Hunter
- Hunters chase — prey runs away
- Fishers attract — choose the right bait, cast, wait for the bite
- "Don't show up and throw up"
- Posture of letting people INTO your business, not getting them into it

### 23. Create Urgency and Fear of Loss
- "Every day after a presentation, odds of joining drop 10%"
- Dangle the carrot: "I have several people joining this week — get in now and I'll place them under you"
- Shop the application: use one recruit's app to close others
- Close with confidence — "Of course they're joining. Why would they miss out?"

### 24. Love Your Family Into Supporting You
- Paint the picture of what success provides for THEM
- Schedule family time as deliberately as business time
- Show appreciation constantly — flowers, dinners, getaways
- "If you're not making your follow-up calls, you're cheating your family"

### 25. Focus on the Starfish
- You can't save them all — focus on the one in your hand
- Pour yourself into each person fully
- "While that may be true, I will impact THIS one's life"
- The ripple effect: one success story inspires hundreds
