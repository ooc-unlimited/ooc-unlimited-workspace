# Agent Activation OS
### From ICA Signed → First Solo Close → First Recruit → CFT
*Last updated: 2026-02-08*

---

## Overview

Every new agent enters one of two tracks based on their license status at ICA signing. Both tracks converge at the same destination: **first solo close → first recruit → CFT path.**

## TRACK A: Licensed Agent Fast Track
*Gary's Edge — This is the primary recruiting lane*

### Why This Track Matters
Gary recruits already-licensed agents from PropHog. These agents have their license but typically:
- Have no team or system
- Got licensed and then hit a wall
- May have joined another agency that didn't support them
- Are sitting on a license doing nothing

**Timeline: ICA to first solo close in 10-14 days**

### Day 0: ICA Signed — Immediate Actions

**Within 1 hour of ICA signing:**

1. **Welcome call (5 min)**
```
"[Name], welcome to the team. Here's exactly what's going to 
happen. I'm not going to hand you off to someone and disappear. 
You and I are going to work through onboarding together, and 
within 2 weeks you're going to be sitting in front of clients 
and closing business. That's not a goal — that's the system.

First thing: I'm scheduling your Onboarding 1 session for 
[Day — within 48 hours]. Before that, I need you to do two 
things..."
```

2. **Homework assignment (due before Onboarding 1):**
   - ✅ Read Chapters 1-3 of *Build an Empire* by Brian Carruthers
   - ✅ Write down their "Why" — 1 paragraph minimum (why they got licensed, what they want their life to look like)
   - ✅ Start their Top 25 list (names + phone numbers of people they know — family, friends, coworkers, neighbors)

3. **Send via text:**
```
"Here's your homework before our first session:

1. Read Ch. 1-3 of Build an Empire by Brian Carruthers 
   (Amazon link: [link])
2. Write your WHY — why you got licensed, what you want your 
   life to look like in 12 months
3. Start your Top 25 list — anyone you know by first name. 
   We'll expand it later.

This isn't optional. If you show up without it done, we 
reschedule. The agents who succeed are the ones who treat 
this like a business from Day 1."
```

### The 7-Day Filter (Anthony's Framework)
**Applied starting Day 0.** The filter is simple:

> *Watch what they DO in the first 7 days, not what they SAY.*

| Signal | Green (Keep Investing) | Red (Pull Back) |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Homework | Done before deadline | Excuses, incomplete, "I forgot" |
| Communication | Responds same day | Goes dark for 48+ hours |
| Questions | Asks "how" questions | Asks "what if it doesn't work" questions |
| Energy | Shows up early, takes notes | Late, distracted, multitasking on Zoom |
| Book | Actually reads it, references it | "Haven't had time" |

**The rule:** If they fail the 7-day filter, you don't chase. You simply say:
```
"Hey [Name], I noticed you haven't been able to get the 
homework done. That tells me the timing might not be right, 
and that's totally okay. When you're ready to commit, I'm here. 
But I'm not going to chase you — that's not how this works."
```

Then archive. Move on. The pipeline refills from PropHog.

### Day 1-2: Onboarding 1 — System & Internal Consumption

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes (Zoom or in-person)
**Conducted by:** Gary (or designated trainer)

#### Agenda:

**1. The 3-Question Drill (5 min)**
Before anything else, ask:
1. **"Why did you get your insurance license?"**
2. **"What's your timeline — when do you need to be making money?"**
3. **"Are you coachable — meaning, will you follow the system exactly as taught, even if it feels uncomfortable?"**

*These answers become their accountability anchors. Write them down. You'll reference them when they want to quit in Week 3.*

**2. Company Overview (15 min)**
- GFI structure: how the hierarchy works (Agent → CFT → MD → EMD)
- Compensation: personal production + overrides + bonuses
- What makes GFI different (system-driven, not sink-or-swim)

**3. Internal Consumption — Become a Client First (20 min)**
- Schedule their **Client Experience** meeting for 48 hours out
- Explain: "Every great agent is also a client. You can't sell something you don't believe in."
- Walk through what the Client Experience looks like
- **This is non-negotiable.** If they won't become a client, they're not the right fit.

**4. Tech Setup (15 min)**
- Carrier contracting via Tevah (Agent Code setup)
- Verify license is posted and active
- iDecide account setup (if building team)
- Confirm they can access all platforms

**5. Week 1 Schedule (10 min)**
- Client Experience meeting: [scheduled for 48 hours out]
- Book reading target: finish by Onboarding 2
- Top 25 list due: bring to Onboarding 2 (they'll expand to Top 100)
- Schedule Onboarding 2 for Day 5-7

**Post-Onboarding 1 text:**
```
"Great first session, [Name]. Quick recap:

✅ Client Experience meeting: [Day/Time]
✅ Finish Build an Empire by [Day]
✅ Expand your Top 25 → Top 50 before our next session
✅ Onboarding 2: [Day/Time]

You're already ahead of 90% of agents who get licensed. 
Let's keep that momentum."
```

### Day 2-3: Client Experience Meeting
- Agent experiences the GFI product as a client
- They see the presentation, the process, the professionalism
- **This builds belief.** They can't sell what they haven't experienced.
- After: confirm they're still committed. If yes → continue. If hesitant → address concerns directly.

### Day 5-7: Onboarding 2 — EMD Handoff + Top 100 List

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Conducted by:** EMD (or Gary if no active EMD)

#### Agenda:

**1. Check homework**
- Did they finish the book? Quiz them:
  - "What was your biggest takeaway?"
  - "What chapter hit you the hardest?"
  - *If they didn't read it, reschedule. Do not proceed.*

**2. The Top 100 List Extraction**
- They brought their Top 50. Now expand to 100.
- Categories to mine:
  - Family (immediate + extended)
  - Friends (childhood, college, work, gym, church)
  - Neighbors (current + previous)
  - Service providers (barber, mechanic, doctor, dentist)
  - Social media connections (scroll through Facebook/Instagram contacts)
  - Parents of their kids' friends
  - Former coworkers
- **The goal is not to call all 100.** The goal is deep market awareness — these are future clients AND recruits.

**3. System Launch Briefing**
- Explain the full GFI system they'll be running
- iDecide presentation walkthrough (they'll use this for prospecting)
- How appointments get set, how field training works
- Set expectations: "You're going to do 10 field training sessions with a trainer before you go solo."

**4. Schedule Onboarding 3**

### Day 7-10: Onboarding 3 — System Launch

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Conducted by:** Gary or CFT

#### Agenda:

**1. Top 100 review + prioritization**
- Mark the top 20 most likely to take a meeting
- Identify any who might be recruitable (interested in the business, not just insurance)

**2. GFI system dry run**
- Walk through the full client acquisition flow
- iDecide → Zoom → Close → Paperwork
- Answer all questions

**3. Transition to 5-Day Ambassador Training**
- Schedule Day 1 of Ambassador Training for next business day

---

### Day 8-14: 5-Day Ambassador Training

**Led by:** CFT (Certified Field Trainer) or senior agent
**Format:** Daily 30-60 min sessions (Zoom or in-person)

| Day | Topic | Focus | Homework |
|-----|-------|-------|----------|
| **1** | ETHOS Script | Term quoting mechanics, Ethos platform, speed apps | Practice script 10x in mirror |
| **2** | Zoom Etiquette | Camera on, lighting, background, professional presence | Record yourself on Zoom, review |
| **3** | Webinar Practice | How to edify, press play, let the system work | Run a mock webinar with trainer |
| **4** | Snapshot + Magic Questions | Fact-finding, needs analysis, building rapport | Write out 10 discovery questions |
| **5** | Full Role Play | Complete presentation: opening → discovery → presentation → close | Must pass role play to proceed |

#### Role Play Pass/Fail Criteria (Day 5)
- ✅ Confident opening and rapport building
- ✅ Asks discovery questions naturally (not reading from script)
- ✅ Smooth transition to presentation
- ✅ Handles at least 3 common objections
- ✅ Asks for the close directly
- ❌ If they fail: repeat Day 4-5 before field training

---

### Day 10-21: Field Training (10 Appointments)

**The Rule:** CFT schedules 10 field training appointments. Do NOT end the scheduling call until all 10 are booked.

**The Market:** Warm market from their Top 100 list.

| Appointment | Format | Agent's Role | Trainer's Role |
|-------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 1-3 | Watch & Learn | Observe, take notes | Trainer runs entire appointment |
| 4-6 | Guided Practice | Agent leads with trainer backup | Trainer interjects if needed |
| 7-9 | Solo with Safety Net | Agent runs it alone | Trainer observes silently, debriefs after |
| 10 | Final Assessment | Agent runs entire appointment solo | Trainer evaluates, gives final feedback |

**After each appointment:**
- 10-minute debrief: What went well? What to improve?
- Rate confidence 1-10
- Log in tracker (see agent-follow-up-tracker.md)

**"The Result is Belief."** — By appointment 10, the agent has seen the product work, seen clients say yes, and has confidence that this is real.

---

### CONVERGENCE POINT: First Solo Close

After 10 field training sessions, the agent is released to produce independently.

**First solo close celebration:**
```
Text: "[Name], you just closed your first deal on your own. 🔥
That's not luck — that's the system working. I'm proud of you. 
Now let's talk about your next 10."
```

**Post-first-close actions:**
1. Celebrate publicly (team group chat, recognition)
2. Set next 10 appointment targets
3. Introduce recruiting conversation (see "First Recruit" below)

---

## TRACK B: Standard Onboarding (Unlicensed Recruits)
*For agents who come in without a license*

### Timeline: ICA to first solo close in 4-6 weeks

### Week 1: License Prep + Internal Consumption

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| 0 | ICA signed. Connect with Licensing Department. Order study materials. |
| 0 | Assign: *Build an Empire* Ch. 1-3 + write "Why" statement |
| 1-2 | Onboarding 1 (same as Track A) — System overview + Client Experience scheduled |
| 2-3 | Client Experience meeting |
| 1-7 | **Study for exam daily.** Gary checks in every 48 hours via text. |

**The "Not Licensed Yet" Deferral:**
When unlicensed agents get antsy about doing business:
```
"I love your energy, but here's the thing — you can't sell 
insurance without a license, and I'm not going to let you cut 
corners. Focus on passing that exam. Once you're licensed, we 
move FAST. The system is ready for you. You just need the license."
```

### Week 2-3: Pass the Exam

- Study daily (2-4 hours minimum)
- Practice exams until scoring 85%+
- Schedule exam as soon as ready
- **Gary follows up every 48 hours:**
```
SMS: "How's the studying going? What chapter are you on?"
```

**If they haven't scheduled the exam by Day 14:**
```
"Hey [Name], we're 2 weeks in and you haven't scheduled your 
exam yet. I need to know — are you serious about this? Because 
I've got a system ready for you, but it doesn't work if you 
don't get licensed. What's the holdup?"
```

### Week 3-4: License Posts → Activate

Once license posts:
1. Carrier contracting via Tevah (same day)
2. Verify license active in state database
3. Schedule Onboarding 2 within 48 hours
4. **From here, Track B follows the exact same path as Track A** (Onboarding 2 → 3 → Ambassador Training → Field Training)

---

## The Path After First Solo Close

### First Recruit

**Timing:** Introduce after 3-5 solo closes (agent has belief + income)

**The Conversation:**
```
"[Name], you've been crushing it. Let me ask you something — 
do you remember what it felt like before you had this system? 
Lost, licensed but not producing?

There are thousands of people right now in that exact same spot. 
What if I showed you how to build a team and earn on THEIR 
production too? Not instead of your sales — on top of it.

You already know the system works. Now imagine 5 people running 
it under you."
```

**Actions:**
1. Train them on the Recruiting OS (garys-recruiting-os.md simplified version)
2. Set first-week recruiting target: 5 iDecide presentations sent from their warm market
3. Help them close their first recruit personally (do the Zoom interview together)

### CFT Path (Certified Field Trainer)

**Requirements to start CFT track:**
- ✅ 10+ field training sessions completed
- ✅ 5+ solo closes
- ✅ 1+ personal recruits
- ✅ Consistent activity (not sporadic bursts)

**CFT In-Progress:**
- Agent begins conducting field training for their own recruits
- Gary or EMD shadows their training sessions
- Must demonstrate they can teach, not just sell

**CFT Sign-Off:**
- Successfully trained 2+ agents through the full field training cycle
- Those agents produced (at least 1 close each)
- CFT receives official certification

### MD (Marketing Director) Path
- Requirements: CFT + 5+ agents producing + personal production targets met
- This is when the agent is truly building an agency, not just selling

### EMD (Executive Marketing Director) Path
- Requirements: MD + multiple MDs under them
- Running the full system independently
- Conducting Onboarding 2 for downline agents

## Anthony's Onboarding Principles (Woven Throughout)

These aren't separate from the system — they ARE the system:

1. **7-Day Filter:** Don't invest in agents who don't invest in themselves. Watch behavior, not words.

2. **3-Question Drill:** "Why did you get licensed?" / "What's your timeline?" / "Are you coachable?" — asked at Onboarding 1, referenced throughout.

3. **Book Assignment:** *Build an Empire* is non-negotiable. It builds mindset before skillset. If they won't read a book, they won't make 50 dials.

4. **Internal Consumption:** Become a client first. You can't sell what you don't own.

5. **"Complexity is the enemy of duplication."** Every step must be simple enough that your newest agent could teach it to THEIR newest agent.

## Activation Timeline Comparison

| Milestone | Track A (Licensed) | Track B (Unlicensed) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| ICA Signed | Day 0 | Day 0 |
| Onboarding 1 | Day 1-2 | Day 1-2 |
| Client Experience | Day 2-3 | Day 2-3 |
| License Exam | Already done ✅ | Day 14-21 |
| Onboarding 2 | Day 5-7 | Day 16-23 |
| Onboarding 3 | Day 7-10 | Day 18-25 |
| Ambassador Training | Day 8-14 | Day 19-30 |
| Field Training (10x) | Day 10-21 | Day 25-42 |
| **First Solo Close** | **Day 14-21** | **Day 30-45** |
| First Recruit | Day 30-45 | Day 45-60 |
| CFT Path Begins | Day 60-90 | Day 75-120 |

**Track A advantage: 2-3 weeks faster to first close.** This is why recruiting licensed agents from PropHog is Gary's edge.
