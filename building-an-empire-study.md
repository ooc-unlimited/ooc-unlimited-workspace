## SECTION 1: SOCIAL MEDIA

### Key Concepts
- **Lifestyle marketing** > direct pitching (90% value / 10% business)
- Post vacations, freedom moments, achievements — let people ASK
- Never hunt on social — fish. Build rapport first.
- Facebook groups for: team culture, customer community, prospect presentations
- ATM method: Add → Tag → Message (private group with pinned presentation)
- Watch parties: upline presents on YOUR page, you keep the prospects
- "The scroll hole" — social media is a tool, not the business itself

### Gary's Implementation

| Concept | Action Item | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Lifestyle marketing | Gary posts his $12K check results, Virtual Office culture, team wins — NOT "join my team" pitches | 🔲 Create content calendar |
| ATM method | Create private Facebook group with pinned iDecide presentation link + success stories | 🔲 Build group |
| Team culture group | Facebook or Telegram group for Gary's team — daily recognition, wins, training clips | 🔲 Set up |
| The scroll hole | Gary's phone time should be 75% calls, 25% social. Not the reverse. | ⚠️ Awareness |
| "Stop selling, start solving" | In SMS/calls: ask about their current situation FIRST, then offer solution | 🔲 Update SMS scripts |

### 🚨 Flag for Gary
- Brian says "stop and go to your computer" to work your list. Gary's equivalent: stop scrolling Ringy and CALL the leads.
- Social media is the LURE, not the CATCH. The phone call is the catch.

---

## SECTION 2: THE POWER OF THE MODEL (Exponential Growth)

### Key Concepts
- 5 recruits × 5 each × 5 years = 3,125 people on 5th level
- "The power of one more" — going from 1 to 2 recruits/month is exponential
- **Build DEEP, not wide**: 4 people making $5K > 20 people making $500
- Taprooting: recruit Mary → help Mary recruit John → help John recruit Tracy → keep going
- A leg needs 3 leaders in a line to be solid
- "Overlapping leadership" — if one leader falls, others hold the leg
- Tree root analogy: follow the main root, explore offshoots

### Gary's Implementation

| Concept | Action Item | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Build deep | Stop trying to recruit 100 wide — focus on 4-5 strong legs and go 10 deep in each | 🔲 Restructure strategy |
| Taproot | For each new ICA agent: immediately ask "who are your 3 sharpest contacts?" and call them | 🔲 Add to onboarding |
| 3 leaders per leg | Identify which legs have 0, 1, 2, or 3 leaders. Prioritize legs with 1-2 leaders. | 🔲 Audit team |
| The power of one more | Current: ~4 personal recruits YTD. Target: 2/month = 24/year. Each getting 1 recruit = 48. | 🔲 Set monthly goal |
| Recruit THROUGH | Every new agent's contact list is the real prize, not the agent themselves | 🔲 Update onboarding script |

### 🚨 Flag for Gary
- Gary has 100 recruited lifetime but low stick rate. Brian would say: you went TOO WIDE. You need to go DEEP with the next 10 recruits instead of recruiting 10 more.
- The 14% Problem is a DEPTH problem. If Gary had taprooted through each of those 70 agents, many more would have stuck.

---

## SECTION 3: RECRUITING STRATEGIES

### Key Concepts
- **Recruit to invite** (not invite to recruit): sign them up FIRST, then bring their guests to events
- **Shop the application**: use one recruit's app to create urgency with others → chain recruiting
- **Long-distance sponsoring**: phone/Zoom works just as well. "A local sponsor can only teach you to build locally."
- **Grab their top 10**: get a copy of every new recruit's contact list. Call the top 10 yourself.
- **The scholarship method**: if they can't pay to start, get them into activity anyway. Use their contacts.
- **Urgency and fear of loss**: "I have several people joining this week — get in now and I'll place them under you"
- **Get in vs let in**: posture of selection, not desperation

### Gary's Implementation

| Concept | Action Item | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Recruit to invite | Don't wait for Grand Opening — recruit agents NOW, bring THEIR people to the event | 🔲 Apply to Grand Opening flow |
| Shop the app | After each ICA, call 5 fence-sitters: "I just signed someone sharp, get in now and they go under you" | 🔲 Create script |
| Grab top 10 | Add to onboarding: "Give me your 10 sharpest contacts. I'll call them myself." | 🔲 Add to activation OS |
| Scholarship method | For agents who can't afford $199: "I'll scholarship you. Let's start working your list now." | 🔲 Create fallback script |
| Fear of loss | "I'm talking to 3 other agents in your area this week. First one in gets the team placed under them." | 🔲 Add to close sequence |
| Get in vs let in | Posture shift: "I'm selecting people for my team" not "please join my team" | ⚠️ Mindset work |

### 🚨 Flag for Gary
- Brian recruited 9 people in ONE DAY by shopping one application. Gary has NEVER done this. This is a massive unlock.
- The scholarship method solves the #1 objection ("I don't want to pay $199") — but use as LAST RESORT, not first offer.

## SECTION 4: MOTIVATE YOUR EMPIRE

### Key Concepts
- **Leadership vs Management**: leaders get people to WANT to do the work; managers TELL them to
- **Paint the vision**: nobody has sat down for an hour to design their life. Help them.
- **Praise progress**: even if PBR had zero guests — praise the EFFORT
- **Inclusion/exclusion**: create things only producers can access (special dinners, trips, badges)
- **Team culture**: weekly calls, team website, fun activities, charity, social groups
- **Call parties**: group dialing sessions with swapped downline lists
- **Contests**: both activity-based (100 No's Challenge) and results-based (Top Recruiter)

### Gary's Implementation

| Concept | Action Item | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Paint the vision | In every interview: "Let me show you what 2 years from now looks like for you..." | 🔲 Add to interview playbook |
| Weekly team call | Set up weekly Zoom/call for Gary's team — recognition + training + stories | 🔲 Schedule |
| Call parties | Monthly group dialing sessions — everyone brings their list, swap contacts | 🔲 Plan first one |
| 100 No's Challenge | Create the challenge for Gary's team: track no's until 5 yes's | 🔲 Design challenge |
| Recognition system | Every ICA, every first sale, every rank advancement = public shout-out | 🔲 Create in team group |
| Inclusion events | Quarterly dinner for top 5 producers. Make it aspirational. | 🔲 Plan |

### 🚨 Flag for Gary
- Gary scored 6.3 and 6.5 on his last two interviews. Brian's framework would rate the CLOSE as the weakest area. Gary needs to create urgency and fear of loss at the end — not "I'll text it to you."
- Brian's 25/25/25/25 time split: Gary should audit where his time actually goes. Is he spending 75% talking to prospects?

---

## SECTION 5: THE MENTAL GAME

### Key Concepts
- **Act as if** you're already at the top — with humility
- **Don't drag your past forward** — if last 10 recruits quit, the next one doesn't know that
- **Positive expectancy**: what you project onto recruits is what they'll do
- **Get pissed off**: use naysayers as fuel, not kryptonite
- **SOS (Shiny Object Syndrome)**: stop looking at other opportunities. Stay the course.
- **Congruence**: actions must match goals. The marble jar visualization.
- **Affirmations**: daily, first-person, present tense declarations
- **Stories inspire**: facts tell, stories sell. Become a master storyteller.
- **The Expect the Pushback**: inoculate new recruits against rejection and naysayers BEFORE it happens

### Gary's Implementation

| Concept | Action Item | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Act as if | Gary IS a Marketing Director pulling $12K checks. Own it. Walk into every Zoom with that energy. | ⚠️ Mindset |
| Don't drag past forward | 86% of agents went cold. But the NEXT one doesn't know that. Fresh energy every call. | ⚠️ Mindset |
| Daily affirmation | Write Gary's custom affirmation and recite every morning | 🔲 Create |
| Expect the Pushback | Create Gary's version for new ICA agents: "Here's what to expect in week 1..." | 🔲 Write document |
| Storytelling | Gary's story IS the story: broke, fired, $100K debt → $12K checks. Use it EVERY interview. | ✅ Already doing this |
| Congruence check | Weekly: "Did my activity this week match my income goal?" | 🔲 Add to weekly accountability |

### 🚨 Flag for Gary
- Brian says: "I faxed my brother my $11K check, then my $24K check, then my $42K check." Gary should TRACK his income milestones and use them as story anchors.
- The Expect the Pushback is CRITICAL. Gary's agents quit because they're not inoculated against the first round of rejection. This needs to be part of onboarding Day 1.

## SECTION 6: MODELING YOUR EMPIRE

### Key Concepts
- **Stay on the elevator**: keep doing Phase 1 even after success
- **Duplicate yourself**: find 1-3 rising stars and pour into them
- **A leader factory**: teach leaders to find and develop their own leaders
- **Whiteboarding**: track 5 metrics for each person you're mentoring monthly
- **The 90-Day Run**: compressed effort → crescendo at a grand finale event
- **Success compression**: 200 calls in 3 days > 200 calls in 3 months
- **Tool blitzes**: group canvassing events with contests
- **The microwave popcorn principle**: consistent heat, no stopping and starting

### Gary's Implementation

| Concept | Action Item | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Whiteboard | Create digital whiteboard tracking 5 metrics per active agent per month | 🔲 Build in Second Brain |
| 90-Day Run | Design Q1 2026 blitz: Feb 9 → May 9. Grand Opening as finale. | 🔲 Plan with Gary |
| Rising stars | From 70 agents, identify 1-3 who could be the "next Gary" and pour into them | 🔲 Audit roster |
| 5 metrics to track | 1) Rank goal 2) Production bonus 3) Personal recruits 4) Sales volume 5) Event attendance | 🔲 Set up tracking |
| Microwave popcorn | Gary's consistency check: are you building every day or stopping and starting? | ⚠️ Awareness |

### 🚨 Flag for Gary
- Brian tracks 5 metrics PER PERSON on a whiteboard. Gary doesn't track ANY metrics per agent. This is the single biggest operational gap.
- The 90-Day Run could be Gary's Grand Opening: recruit hard for 90 days → Grand Opening as the finale event → recognition gala.

---

## SECTION 7: THE BUILDER'S ACTIONS & BEHAVIORS

### Key Concepts
- **The Ultimate Day**: Brian's hour-by-hour schedule (9 AM → 9:30 PM)
- **IPA first thing**: 3-5 calls before anything else. Defeats call reluctance.
- **Drive time = call time**: never waste travel time
- **Schedule downtime**: block family time just like business time
- **Treat it like a business**: 9 behaviors of a real business owner
- **Networking groups**: slow down to speed up — build deep relationships locally
- **Journal your journey**: document everything for your future story
- **Family buy-in**: paint the picture, show appreciation, involve the kids
- **Managing contacts**: CRM is essential, work the existing list
- **Avoid month-end crunch**: build urgency in the first 48 hours, not the last

### Gary's Implementation

| Concept | Action Item | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| IPA first thing | Gary's morning: 3-5 calls to prospects BEFORE checking email/Ringy/social | 🔲 Add to morning routine |
| Drive time university | Car time = calls or personal development audio. No music, no scrolling. | 🔲 Habit |
| CRM discipline | Ringy IS the CRM. But it needs to be WORKED, not just stored. 14% call rate = unacceptable. | 🔲 Daily call commitment |
| First 48 hours | At the start of each month: blitz the first 2 days. Set the tone. | 🔲 Monthly ritual |
| Journal | Daily journal in Second Brain — Gary can review his own growth over time | ✅ Donna handles this |
| Family buy-in | Jennifer and kids need to see the WHY. Disney jar equivalent for Cosby family. | 🔲 Discuss with Gary |
| 9 business behaviors | Audit: events ✅, calls ⚠️, tracking 🔲, investment ⚠️, defeat learning ✅, customers ⚠️, integrity ✅, distribution ⚠️, taxes ⚠️ | 🔲 Full audit |

### 🚨 Flag for Gary
- Brian's daily schedule is 12+ hours of intentional business activity. Gary's current daily activity level is TBD — needs honest self-assessment.
- The "avoid month-end crunch" maps to Gary's Grand Opening planning: build momentum BEFORE the event, not scramble at the end.

## QUESTIONS FOR GARY

1. How many calls are you ACTUALLY making per day right now? (Be honest — Brian would want the real number.)
2. Of your 70 ICA'd agents, who are your top 3 "rising stars" you'd pour into?
3. Have you ever "shopped an application"? (Used one recruit's signup to close others?)
4. Would you do a 90-Day Run starting now? What would your Grand Opening finale look like?
5. What's your biggest fear when you pick up the phone? (Let's kill it.)
