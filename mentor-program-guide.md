# OOC Unlimited Mentor Program Guide

*"The recruiter sells the dream. The mentor makes it real."*

---

## Why Mentorship Matters

**Industry fact:** Agencies with structured mentor programs retain agents at 2x the rate of those without. The research is clear — the recruiter should NOT be the primary support contact after ICA. Different relationship, different energy.

**Gary's role:** Recruit, inspire, set the vision, conduct reviews.  
**Mentor's role:** Keep the agent alive for 90 days. Manage emotions. Normalize the struggle.

## Who Qualifies as a Mentor

### Requirements
- ✅ Closed at least 5 deals
- ✅ Past their own 90-day mark
- ✅ Willing to commit to 6 scheduled touchpoints + weekly texts
- ✅ Positive, patient, and honest
- ✅ Ideally NOT the person who recruited the agent

### Disqualifiers
- ❌ Still in their own first 90 days
- ❌ Negative attitude or currently disengaged
- ❌ Too busy to commit to the schedule
- ❌ Treats it as a favor, not a responsibility

### Current Mentor Candidates (Gary to fill)
| Name | Deals Closed | Days Active | Available? |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|

*Until you have qualified mentors, Gary = default mentor. That's not ideal but it's better than nothing.*

## The 6 Touchpoint System

### Touchpoint 1: Day 1 (Text + Call)
**Purpose:** Introduce yourself, set expectations, build initial trust.

**Text:**
> "Hey [NAME]! It's [MENTOR]. Gary told me about you and I'm pumped to be your go-to person. I went through the exact same thing you're going through right now, so anything you need — questions, venting, whatever — I'm here. Let's hop on a quick 10-min call today or tomorrow. What works?"

**Call Agenda (10 min):**
1. Share YOUR story briefly (how you started, your first week feelings)
2. Ask about their WHY
3. Set expectations: "I'll check in on Days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 30. These aren't optional — they're how we make sure you succeed."
4. Give them permission to struggle: "The first 2 weeks are the hardest. That's normal. Don't make any decisions about this business until Day 30."

### Touchpoint 2: Day 3 (Text)
**Purpose:** Check the emotional temperature. Did pushback happen?

> "Hey [NAME]! Quick check-in — have you told anyone yet about what you're doing? What was their reaction? (Don't worry, whatever they said is normal. I'll tell you what happened to me 😂)"

**If they say nobody pushed back:** Great! It's coming though. Be ready.  
**If they got pushback:** Normalize it. Share your own story. Remind them it's a sign of courage, not a mistake.

### Touchpoint 3: Day 7 (Call — 15 min)
**Purpose:** One week check-in. Identity reinforcement.

**Agenda:**
1. "On a scale of 1-10, how are you feeling about this decision?"
2. "What have you done this week?" (CE progress, group chat, etc.)
3. "Tell me about your WHY again." (Repetition locks identity)
4. Preview what's coming: "This next week is when the real stuff starts. We're going to get you in front of someone."

### Touchpoint 4: Day 14 (Call — 15 min)
**Purpose:** Action check. First appointment should be happening around now.

**Agenda:**
1. "Have you had your first appointment yet?"
   - **Yes:** CELEBRATE. Ask how it went. Debrief the experience.
   - **No:** Don't shame. Ask what's blocking it. Offer to help schedule one.
2. "How's your prospect list? Have you reached out to any of your Top 5?"
3. If stuck: "What if we set up ONE appointment together this week? I'll walk you through the text to send."

**🚨 If Day 14 and no CE complete, no appointments, no engagement → flag as at-risk to Stacy/Gary.**

### Touchpoint 5: Day 21 (Text + Optional Call)
**Purpose:** Objection handling check. They've been in conversations by now.

> "3 weeks in! What objections are you hearing the most? From prospects? From yourself? Let's talk through them — I've heard every single one and I've got answers for all of them."

**If they're producing:** Shift to growth mode. "Let's talk about getting to 5 appointments this week."  
**If they're not producing:** Direct conversation needed. "Real talk — what's getting in the way? Let's figure this out together."

### Touchpoint 6: Day 30 (Call — 20 min)
**Purpose:** 30-day review prep. Honest assessment.

**Agenda:**
1. "You've been in this for a month. Tell me honestly — how do you feel?"
2. Review numbers: appointments, applications, commission earned
3. "What's been the hardest part?"
4. "What's been the best part?"
5. Prep for 30-Day Review with Gary: "Gary's going to ask you about your goals and your numbers. Be honest with him. He's not looking for perfection — he's looking for commitment."

## After Day 30: Weekly Text Check-ins

From Day 30 through Day 90, send a weekly text every Monday:

**Template rotation:**
- Week 5: "New week, new opportunities. What's your #1 goal this week?"
- Week 6: "How many appointments do you have booked this week?"
- Week 7: "Wins from last week? Even small ones count. Drop them here."
- Week 8: "Grand Opening prep — how's the invite list looking?"
- Week 9: "Almost at 60 days. How does it feel compared to Day 1?"
- Week 10-13: Continue rotating through goals, wins, accountability

## Red Flags to Escalate

Flag immediately to Stacy (who flags to Gary):

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Agent doesn't respond to 2 consecutive touchpoints | Escalate same day |
| Agent says "I'm thinking about quitting" | Call immediately, then escalate |
| No CE completion by Day 10 | Escalate |
| No appointment by Day 21 | Escalate |
| Agent is negative in group chat | Private message first, then escalate |
| Agent missed 2+ accountability calls | Escalate |

---

## What Mentoring Is NOT

- ❌ Teaching product knowledge (that's Austin/Doug/Chris + training)
- ❌ Being their therapist (you're a guide, not a counselor)
- ❌ Doing their work for them (empower, don't enable)
- ❌ Making excuses for them (accountability with love)
- ❌ Replacing Gary's relationship (you supplement it)

---

## Recognition for Mentors

*Suggestion for Gary to implement:*
- Public shoutout when their mentee hits first check
- "Mentor of the Month" recognition
- Small bonus ($25-50) when a mentee completes 90 days
- Eventually: "Senior Mentor" title for those who've graduated 5+ agents

---

*The mentor doesn't need to be the best producer. They need to be the best listener. The agent already has Gary for inspiration. They need someone for the 11 PM doubt spiral.*
