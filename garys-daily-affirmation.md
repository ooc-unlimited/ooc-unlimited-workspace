# 🔥 Gary's Daily Affirmation
*Read aloud every morning before your first call. Mean every word.*

---

I am building a financial empire that will outlive me.

I am a Marketing Director who went from $100K in debt to $12K checks — and I'm just getting started.

I recruit every single day because RITA is the answer. Recruiting Is The Answer. Always.

I am not selling insurance. I am rescuing people from the life I escaped — broke, overlooked, and starting from zero with no one showing them the way.

Every person I call today could be the next me. Every "no" brings me closer to the next "yes." Every rejection is a filter, not a failure.

I will make my first 5 calls before I check my phone, before I scroll, before I do anything else. Because IPA comes first. Always.

My father didn't have life insurance. That's why I'm here. That fire doesn't go out.

I am a warrior for freedom. I am a fearless leader. People want to work with me because I show up, I follow through, and I care about their success more than my own comfort.

My team watches what I do, not what I say. So today, I will do the work that I want them to duplicate.

If my downline did what I did today, how much money would I be making?

I am because I say I am. And today, I will find the next me.
