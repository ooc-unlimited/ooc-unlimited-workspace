# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: 2026-02-13*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** OOC Unlimited helps people build life-changing careers in financial services — mission before commission.
**What it does:** We recruit, train, and support licensed insurance agents to build their own businesses selling life insurance, IULs, annuities, and term products. We provide the system, tools, onboarding, and mentorship so agents can start earning immediately instead of figuring it out alone.
**Product category:** Insurance recruiting / financial services career opportunity
**Product type:** Service + team-building (MLM-adjacent but legitimate — licensed financial professionals)
**Business model:** Override commissions on downline agent production + personal client sales. Agents pay $199 ICA fee to join. Carriers pay commissions on policies sold.

## Target Audience

### Recruiting Side (Primary Revenue Driver)
**Target people:** Licensed insurance agents who are frustrated, undertrained, or stuck at their current agency. Also: newly licensed agents and career-changers who just got licensed.
**Decision-makers:** The individual agent — this is a personal career decision
**Primary use case:** "I have my license but I'm not making money. I need a better system, better support, and better comp."
**Jobs to be done:**
- Find a team/agency where I can actually succeed
- Get trained on how to sell (not just how to pass the exam)
- Build residual income and eventually my own team
- Stop being abandoned after signing up
**Use cases:**
- Licensed agent found via PropHog → SMS drip → iDecide presentation → Zoom interview → ICA
- Career changer (teacher, retail, military) who got licensed but has zero warm market
- Agent at another agency making $0 because nobody trained them

### Client Side (Where Gary Needs to Close More)
**Target clients:** Families and individuals who need life insurance, retirement planning, or wealth protection
**Primary use case:** "I know I need life insurance but I don't know where to start or who to trust"
**Jobs to be done:**
- Protect my family if something happens to me
- Build tax-advantaged retirement savings (IUL)
- Get affordable term coverage now

## Problems & Pain Points

### For Recruits
**Core problem:** The insurance industry recruits people, takes their $199, and abandons them. 90% fail in the first 90 days because nobody actually trains them or gives them a system.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- Most agencies recruit and ghost — no real onboarding
- Training is "watch these videos" with no hands-on support
- No lead generation strategy provided — "just call your friends and family"
- Compensation is confusing, no transparency
**What it costs them:** Months of wasted time, $199+ lost, blown confidence, career restart
**Emotional tension:** "Am I getting scammed? Is this really going to work? I can't afford to waste more time."

### For Clients
**Core problem:** People know they need life insurance but the industry makes it confusing, pushy, and transactional.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- Agents push products for commission, not for the client's actual need
- Online tools are impersonal and confusing
- Nobody explains WHY a product is right for them
**What it costs them:** Unprotected families, missed tax advantages, financial anxiety
**Emotional tension:** "What if something happens to me and my family has nothing?"

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** Other insurance agencies/IMOs recruiting licensed agents (Symmetry, PHP, WFG, Primerica) — fall short because they mass-recruit with no real support system, high churn
**Secondary:** Solo career path (agent goes independent) — falls short because no mentorship, no team, no leverage
**Indirect:** Staying in current career (Best Buy, teaching, etc.) — falls short because income ceiling, no equity, no freedom

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- Gary's personal story (fired from Best Buy, $100K debt, built this from nothing — he IS the target recruit)
- "Mission before commission" — we solve problems first, money follows
- Full onboarding system (not "figure it out yourself")
- Real comp transparency — 100% payout on key products (F&G IUL, Ameritas WL, Ethos Term)
- Tech-enabled: GHL automation, CRM pipeline, AI-assisted recruiting
- Grand Opening model — community events that build agent confidence and client pipeline simultaneously
**How we do it differently:** We built the system we wished existed when we started. Every step from ICA to first sale is mapped, automated, and supported.
**Why that's better:** Instead of 90-day failure, agents hit their first sale faster and stick longer.
**Why customers choose us:** "Gary gets it because he lived it. This isn't theory — it's a proven path."

## Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "$199 is too much" | It's your ICA fee — every agency charges it. We invest MORE than $199 in your training and tools. This filters out people who aren't serious. |
| "Where do I get leads?" | We have a full lead strategy: PropHog for agent recruiting, referral system for clients, Grand Opening events, and we're building digital lead gen. You won't be cold-calling your aunt. |
| "I don't want to build a team" | You don't have to. You can earn great money just selling. But when you see the override income, you'll want to. We don't pressure it. |
| "The comp seems low" | Look at the actual grid — 100% payout on F&G IUL, Ameritas WL, Ethos Term. Show me another agency doing that at your level. |
| "Is this an MLM?" | We sell licensed financial products regulated by state insurance departments. Every agent must be licensed. This is a real career, not a scheme. |

**Anti-persona:** People looking for get-rich-quick with no work. Unlicensed people who won't study for the exam (though we now help non-licensed people GET licensed). Anyone who won't pick up the phone.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Current agency ignores them, no training, no leads, making $0, feeling scammed
**Pull:** Gary's story resonates, full system provided, transparent comp, "mission before commission" ethos, community (Grand Openings, team culture)
**Habit:** "I already signed with another agency" / "I've been here X months, maybe it'll get better" / Sunk cost on existing training
**Anxiety:** "What if this is the same thing?" / "Can I really make money?" / "$199 again?" / "What if I fail again?"

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "I got my license and then nobody helped me"
- "I don't know where to find clients"
- "My upline doesn't return my calls"
- "I feel like I wasted my money"
- "I've been licensed for 6 months and haven't made a dime"
**How they describe us:**
- "Gary actually picked up the phone"
- "They have a real system"
- "First time someone explained the comp honestly"
**Words to use:** mission, system, support, proven, transparent, licensed, career, freedom, family protection, financial security
**Words to avoid:** MLM, network marketing, downline (externally), passive income (sounds scammy), "be your own boss" (overused), "unlimited earning potential" (everyone says this)
