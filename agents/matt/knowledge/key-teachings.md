# Key Teachings — Matt 🏋️ Knowledge Base
*Distilled from all GFI transcripts and handbooks*

---

## 1. BELIEF & IDENTITY

### Recruit Yourself First (Marty Schaefer)
> "If you're not attractive, people won't be attracted to you."

Before you recruit anyone else, you must fully believe in the opportunity. This means daily auto-suggestions, reading your goals out loud, living in the reality of what you're building. The question isn't "did you get a code number" — it's "are you ALL IN with your heart and soul?"

### Those Who Believe Will Be Believed (Matt Welsh)
> "Those who believe will be believed, and those who are convinced will be convincing."

Influence is: "I believe that you believe what you're saying." That's it. If you want to increase your influence as a recruiter, closer, or leader — increase your belief first.

### Be, Do, Have (Tavares Dove)
From Genesis 1:26-28: Be fruitful (identity) → multiply (action) → have dominion (results). The promotion won't make you — you make the promotion. Step into the identity of an EMD NOW, before you have the title.

### The Death Crawl (Academy Opener)
Brock thought he could go to the 30. Coach blindfolded him. He crawled to the end zone with a man on his back. The lesson: Don't set limits. Don't look at the yardage. Give your absolute best, blindfolded, until you have nothing left.

### Get a PhD in Selling the Dream (Eric Olson)
> "Some of you got a PhD in negativity. Some of you got a PhD in complaining. Get a PhD in selling the dream."

Eric told Matt Welsh: "I need you to get a PhD in selling the dream." Matt did it. Now he makes $5M/year. Success leaves clues.

## 2. RECRUITING

### The Biggest Recruiters Always Win (Greg Kapp → Matt Welsh)
> "Everyone always says that recruiters don't know how to produce — until they finally learn how to produce. And then they produce more than everyone."

Recruiting breeds skill. Recruiting + skill = production spikes. Volume → quality. You're in the business of finding talent, not manufacturing motivation.

### Shoot Past Your Target
If you want 10, shoot for 25. If you want 25, shoot for 40. The reason you don't hit goals is because they're too low. Worst case, you land on your actual target.

### The 3 C's of Recruiting (Tavares Dove)
1. **Contact** — Say hello to everyone who crosses your path. Store, gas station, kids' sporting events.
2. **Curiosity** — Ask questions. "That's a nice purse, where'd you get that?" / "Is this something you've always loved or did you fall into it?"
3. **Consistency** — Plan it. Two hours daily of power hour phone calls.

### January Is Always the Biggest Recruiting Month
Everyone's in "new year, new me" mode. You have an excuse to talk to everyone.

### Find Already Motivated People
> "You can't change someone's level of ambition." — Steve Siebold

Run high volume to find already motivated, already disciplined people who want to change — instead of trying to change people.

### Study Two Things (Tavares Dove)
1. **Human nature** — that's how you close (How to Win Friends & Influence People, Skills with People by Les Giblin)
2. **Leadership** — that's how you move (21 Irrefutable Laws, 360 Degree Leader)

## 3. THE GFI SYSTEM

### SYSTEM = Save Yourself Time Energy & Money
> "You don't run a business, you run a system, and the system runs your business."

The worst thing you can do is pick and choose which parts to run. Every piece is strategically placed.

### Three Building Phases
1. **Phase 1 — Recruiting Volume:** Prospect → Trainee
2. **Phase 2 — Field Training:** Trainee → Trainer (CFT)
3. **Phase 3 — Leadership Development:** Trainer → EMD

### System A-Z Flow
1. **Recruiting Interview** → Schedule Onboarding 1 for next day
2. **Onboarding 1** → Schedule PFR with spouse, licensing class, Onboarding 2. Goal: see the crusade, see the need, want to become a client, commit to license in 7 days
3. **Onboarding 2** (done by EMD) → Profile top 100 business partner list, start building them an agency, schedule 3-5 recruiting interviews for them, add 10 recruits in 7 days
4. **Licensing** → Test date within 24 hours of coding. 7-day standard.
5. **Onboarding 3** (done by CFT) → Profile top 25 field training list (half age 50+ for rollover market), role-play scripts until bulletproof, set 10 qualified field training appointments
6. **10 Field Trainings** → Complete in MACHO market, half in rollover market. 15 min role-play after each. 20 min illustration training before each closing.
7. **CFT In Progress** → Daily classes Mon-Fri teaching independent presentation skills
8. **CFT Sign-Off** → Signed off by trainer, CFT coordinator, AND EMD. Must present to spouse/friend 10 times.
9. **Marketing Director** → $50K watch
10. **EMD** → $100K ring, agency ownership

### The 7-Day Standard
Within 7 days of coding: Onboarding 1, licensing (test date scheduled), PFR with spouse, attend New Agent Onboarding School

### Never Leave an Appointment Without an Appointment
The busier you get, the more you'll forget. Always schedule the next step before you leave.

## 4. SCRIPTS

### Script 1: 3 Good Qualities Script (Recruiting)
Used by trainer during Onboarding 2 to build the new agent an agency:

> "Hello, may I speak to (NAME)? How is it going, my name is (TRAINER) and your good friend ________ referred you to us, do you know _________? Awesome. Well I'm not sure if he told you or not but he recently took a position with our firm and we have been super impressed, so we asked him if he knew anyone that he thought could be a great fit and he thought of you. (TRAINEE) said that you were _________, ___________, and _________, are these great things true about you? Well that's good to hear. I really like (TRAINEE) and know he's not the type of person that would just refer anyone over to us. So based off his recommendation we wanted to set up an interview with you in the next day or so to get to know you more and give more clarity on the positions to see if it's a good fit. What does your schedule look like tomorrow?"

### Script 2: Field Training Script (Setting Appointments)
Used by new agent during Onboarding 3:

> "Hey how are you? (Small Talk). Well the reason I am calling is because I just took a position with Global Financial Impact, and I'm super excited about it. I'm actually going through training right now and your support would mean the world to me. So I was wondering if you and (SPOUSE) would help me out?"
>
> *"Of course, what would you need from us?"*
>
> "All we would do is hop on a quick zoom in the next day or so where my trainer will share with you who we are and what I'll be doing in my new career path so I can learn, but also, that way if you ever come across anyone who would benefit from what we do, you can have confidence referring them to me. So what day works better for you both, Tomorrow or the next day?"

### Common Objection Responses (Field Training Script)

**"What is the company name?"**
> "The company is Global Financial Impact, and we work with 20+ multi-billion dollar financial institutions. We do business not only here in the United States but also in 33 other countries!"

**"Does my spouse need to be there?"**
> "In order for me to get full credit, both of you are requested to be there."

**"Do I need to buy anything?"**
> "No, it's just for my training and to gain support."

**"Is this an MLM?"**
> "No, we are a financial firm and regulated a lot like a bank."

**"What will I be doing?"**
> "My trainer is just going to share with you what I'll be doing so I can learn, and also so I can gain support."

## 5. CLOSING & FIELD TRAINING

### Field Train, Don't Field Sell
If an agent goes through field training and can't do it alone, you dropped the ball as a trainer. Develop independent trainers, not dependent salespeople.

### The 4 Buckets
1. Bills/Expenses
2. Fun Fund
3. Emergency Fund
4. Wealth Accumulation

**Bucket 3 + Bucket 4 = Monthly IUL Premium illustrated.** Start the client on Bucket 4 amount. After 3-5 months of emergency fund built, redirect Bucket 3 into Bucket 4 to overfund the IUL.

### Smoking Out the Money
> "Are you in love with your (account), or would you be open to a better option? So if we could potentially redirect the money that you were contributing to your (account), and redirect it into an account that grows indexed and tax-advantaged, you would be open to that?"

### 5 Magic Questions
Gather from client during Onboarding 1 / Service Menu: "Out of these 10 areas, what matters most to you and your family?"

### Presentation Tools
- **Agency Rocket** — Client presentation video/tool
- **Annuities Genius** — Annuity illustration software
- **GFI Rocket** — Full presentation platform
- **GRIPP** — Financial assessment
- **DIME** — Life insurance needs formula
- **iDecide** — Interactive presentation (GFI standard + Welcome to GFI for higher stature)

### Where Clients Come From (Systemized)
1. **Internal Consumption** — Every recruit should also be a client. 10 recruits = 10 clients minimum.
2. **Field Training** — 10 appointments → 7 should want help → 7 clients
3. **Referrals** — 10 field trainings should generate 30 referrals (3 per appointment)

### Post-Training: CFT In Progress Weekly Schedule
| Day | Class 1 | Class 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | Zoom Etiquette, Non-Captive, Credibility | 4 Buckets |
| Tuesday | 3 Rules of Money | IUL Illustration Software |
| Wednesday | 8 Wealth Building Categories, Agency Rocket, GRIPP | Annuities Genius |
| Thursday | Full Presentation | Full Client Presentation |
| Friday | Service Menu & 5 Magic Questions | GFI Rocket |

## 6. BUILDING A MILLION POINT BASE SHOP

### The Math
50 licensed agents × 20,000 points/year (industry average) = 1,000,000 points. Target 50,000 points per license per year as your standard.

### Key Strategies
- **25+ recruits per month** in your base shop
- **Strong staff (Dream Team)** — Don't take salespeople out of the field for back-office work
- **EMD must be the #1 closer** on their team — if you're not field training agents, who is?
- **Transfer skill, not just motivation** — A skilled base shop outperforms a motivated one
- **Keep it simple & repetitive** — "This business is not about saying new things to old people. It's about saying the same old things to new people."
- **Hot environment** — Hot Zoom (cameras on, engaging), hot group chat (nonstop recognition), hot in-person
- **Frontline leaders** — 15K personal points + 2 directs OR 20K personal points per quarter
- **MD Factory** — Spend time with Field Associates, not MDs. MDs already know. Create MDs → EMDs pop out.
- **Executive Exchange** — When MD promotes to EMD, they leave their best MD leg in your base shop. For the rest of their career, you receive exchange legs.
- **Find a new rabbit every month** — Get a newcomer big results fast, spotlight them. Creates competition.
- **Quarterly in-person retreats** — "We train online but build people in person"

### Agent Retention
- **Hero-making environment** — Every person has an invisible sign: "Make Me Feel Special"
- **Celebrate every milestone** — LP30/LP60, first cycle, field associate, net license, CFT, etc.
- **First 60 days focus** — If you lose them there, you lose them forever
- **Onboarding recognition flyers** — Use GFI pre-made flyers, recognize on all chats and weekly meetings

## 7. EMD PATH

### Current Requirements (as of Jan 2026)
- **Can now be achieved in 3 months** (was 6-12 months)
- 12 licensed agents
- 150,000 points in rolling 6 months OR 240,000 points in rolling 12 months
- 1 Marketing Director leg
- $100,000 ring
- 1/2 of points must be personal

### The EMD Sprint Framework
1. Set March 31st (or current quarter-end) as hard deadline
2. "All out for 80 days" mentality
3. 10 personal sales/month + 10 team recruits/month × 3 months
4. 30 appointments per week minimum
5. Get 3 direct → they each get 3 → 12 on team → 3×3×3 math
6. Think: "Am I willing to go all out for 80 days to change my last name for 80 years?"

### Two Hats (Eric Olson)
- **Founder Hat:** Master selling the dream, inspirational marketing, 5 F's, building relationships
- **CEO Hat:** Business ratios, metrics, inspecting what you expect, managing like a real business

## 8. THE GFI OPPORTUNITY (Talking Points)

### Why GFI Is Different — Quick Hits
- Fully independent, no debt, no investors
- Direct carrier contracts with 14 platinum companies
- Contractual ownership (not "subject to change without notice")
- POP program — first virtuous equity pay cycle ever
- 100% advances, 12 months annualized
- 133% total field payout
- EMD in 3 months (industry-first speed)
- Teva Technologies — proprietary fintech platform
- $1.2B current valuation, targeting $30B by 2030
- 56,000+ associates in 2 years from zero
- 20+ millionaires in 20 months (vs. competitors with 2 after 15 years)
- International (US, Canada, Puerto Rico, Colombia, 33+ countries)
- $200M paid to field in year 2
- "The only independent platform company that hasn't had their equity event"

### The POP Program Explained
- Partnership Ownership Program
- Legally binding 144-page documents (cost $500K to create)
- Senior partners get same multiple as GFI (30x)
- Your EBITDA × 30 = your equity value
- Example: $5M/year income × 30 = $150M. 20% to junior partners/EMDs. Net $120M.
- Spouses on the contract. Beneficiaries. Generational.
- "How come no one's done this before? Because they never gave a shit about their people." — Sandra Olson

### H-O-H vs S-O-S (Eric Olson)
- **H-O-H:** Honor of Helping — we're HELPING people, not selling
- **S-O-S:** Shame of Selling — this is the wrong mindset
- "If you know that you're helping people, you'll talk to everybody"

### Not Accessories, Necessities
> "Every other company is trying to make you spend your money. All we're trying to do is help you save your money."

## 9. MINDSET & CULTURE

### Art Williams Quote (Eric's Daily Listen)
> "Most people can't stay positive for 24 hours or more."

Challenge: Stay positive, excited, fired up — no matter what — for 24 hours straight. Then do it again.

### Obsession (Cody Sanchez via Eric)
> "There's really one thing that separates millionaires: Obsession."

Eric's obsession: delivering on the dream he sold. Your obsession should be becoming the best version of yourself, 1% better every day.

### Hug-Jab-Hug (Feedback Culture)
Also called bun-meat-bun or soft-hard-soft. 200 things to be excited about in GFI. One or two things to get better on. Lead with the positive, address the gap, close with encouragement.

### Width = Wealth, Depth = Stability
Go wide (recruit) for income. Go deep (taproot) for stability. You need both.

### The Founder (Movie Reference, Tavares Dove)
> "I don't think you understand what business you're in."

When you truly believe people's lives will change, you'll talk to everyone.

### One Percenter Mentality
- To become a 1%er ($500K+/year): Look at what 99% does, do the exact opposite
- OR: Focus on helping the other 99%, and you become a 1%er
- "You're the chosen one. You're the bloodline breaker. You're the generational peak person."

### Casual = Casualty
> "Casual people become casualties in business."

### I Work Half Days
> "I work half days — 12 hours a day. The other 12, I do whatever I want." — Eric Olson

## 10. DELIBERATE INTENTION (Coach DC Framework — Feb 2026)

### The Core Concept
Stop winging leadership. Every interaction, every check-in, every meeting should be with **deliberate intention**. DC unveiled this alongside the updated Prolific onboarding system (first update in 4+ years, co-built with Matt Welsh).

### Key Phrases
- **"If nothing changes, nothing changes"** — the wake-up call
- **"Every day is one LESS day, not one MORE day"** — urgency reframe
- **"Drag them across the finish line"** — be specific about what each person needs to hit their target
- **"We're winging leadership — not anymore"** — intentional > reactive
- **"The system takes the thinking out of our business"** — if we gotta think about what's next, we're not running a system
- **"We can't microwave leaders"** — onboarding takes 45-90 min, don't rush it

### The Baby Analogy (First 7 Days)
> "The most important days of a baby's life are the first 7 days."

New agents are the same. First 7 days after coding: text them every day, they text you every day. Constant contact. This is when they're most vulnerable and most impressionable.

### Mid-Month / Mid-Quarter Check-In Strategy
Don't wait until end of month to find out someone missed. Check in deliberately:
- **Mid-month**: Where are your numbers? What do you need to close the gap?
- **Mid-quarter**: Are you on pace for Next Wave? Frontline? EMD?
- Quick 10-15 minute Zooms — not always hour-long meetings
- **Phone zones**: Sunday after church, call 2-4 people, get on Zoom, make calls together
- **Deliberately generate activity**: Get on Zoom with 2 senior associates, don't get off until you book 5 appointments

### Next Wave & Frontline Requirements (Minimum Standards)
- **Next Wave** = 5,000 points + 1 direct recruit per quarter
- **Frontline** = 25,000 points + 6 directs per quarter
- Push every person to at least Next Wave — break it down to the minimums
- If they're close, **drag them across the finish line**

### EMD Graduation Dates
- **Q1** — March 31st cycle
- **Q2** — June 30th cycle
- **November 30th** — special graduation
- Plan backwards from these dates

### Company Rankings Context (Path to Partnership)
- **58,000+ total GFI agents**
- **Top 100** starts at only ~$209K cash flow
- #71 is at $284K — "one fat sale" difference between ranks
- Top names: Resendez $650K, Sloss $474K, Sepulveda $450K
- **"You are a lot closer than you think"** — DC's message to every MD

### Field Training = Product Education
> "Field training is where product education happens — not Zoom."

Don't send new agents to financial/carrier trainings until after net license. Keep their mindset on **rapid expansion** — recruiting, grand openings, building. Product knowledge comes through doing field appointments with a trainer, not sitting in Thursday Zoom classes.

## 11. THE UPDATED PROLIFIC SYSTEM (Feb 2026)

### Background
- Co-built by Coach DC and Matt Welsh (Field Chairman)
- First system update in **4 years and 2 months** (since Dec 2021)
- Welsh cut ~80% of old content — massively streamlined
- Combined GFI company lingo with Prolific system

### The 3-Part Onboarding Flow

#### Onboarding 1 (Within 48 Hours of Code — Personal, 1-on-1)
- Schedule exam (7-10 day target)
- Client experience: 4 buckets, IUL Family Bank, flagship products
- Baby analogy: first 7 days = daily contact
- Tell them what's next: "Tuesday, your first class is orientation"
- Can take 45-90 min — OK to split into two sessions
- For **licensed agents coming in**: skip licensing steps, go straight to client experience, upgrade their existing products to GFI carriers

#### Onboarding 2 (After License)
- Business plan
- Set grand opening date
- Set net license date
- Set CFT date
- Deliberate intention — go ballistic on setting appointments after grand opening

#### Onboarding 3 (Post-Grand Opening) — THE BREAKTHROUGH
- **"If we get them to Onboarding 3, they'll be an EMD"**
- By this point they've done all the awkward stuff: 3-way texts, became a client, spouse meeting, grand opening
- Now teach them the FULL SYSTEM: compensation, contracts, 5 ways to gain clients
- Action steps: send 3-way texts with CPAs, teachers, professionals
- System progression tracker
- Scripts for objections (spouse needed? MLM? buy anything?)

### T3 Tuesday Breakout Rooms (6 Max)
1. **Orientation** — industry overview, GFI story, vision
2. **Grand Opening** — prep, scripts, practice
3. **Onboarding 1** — system walkthrough (MDs/EMDs teach)
4. **Onboarding 2** — business plan class
5. **Onboarding 3** — post-grand opening, field training, expansion
6. **(Optional)** — prospecting, social media, etc.

### Weekly Rhythm
- **Tuesday (T3)** = System, agency building, recruiting
- **Thursday (T2)** = Technical/financial, carrier trainings
- New agents attend Tuesday ONLY until net license

### Staff/Operations Flow (Prolific Standard)
- Karen sends **same-day welcome email** upon ICA
- Includes: welcome message, Instagram, Ethos personal website, state requirements
- **3-way text** intro with upline/recruiter
- Schedule licensing call immediately
- Spouses → operations partners from day one
