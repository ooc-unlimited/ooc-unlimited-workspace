# Marty Day One — Transcript

And I have a history of presidents.
A history of presidents, right?
I would probably say in my career I've been led by multiple presidents, but this is the best president you can ever have.
Right? He's there for us, he has a vision, he has an eye on the plug, he knows where we're going before we're going there.
And I think he has a good perspective in business that we've never had before.
He's not just a president of ours, he's a partner of ours.
Right? So he's a little bit different than anyone else does.
I would say he's a friend of mine, and I give this chance to be, obviously, he's my kind as well.
And I get a chance to take care of him financially.
We just had a conversation too about a deep reading about some things that we've got to change pretty soon.
No, I'm just kidding. But my point is that this gentleman is a blessing.
And we all know that we have a big vision and he has to work with our vision.
And so I want to give a huge round of applause to our president, Marty Schaefer!
Thank you very much.
You never get any sales, you don't ask for it.
I am constantly asking for sales.
I feel like I should just sit down.
This is pretty awesome up here.
Oh, it's good to see you. How you doing?
How's everybody doing?
You guys can sit.
It's great to be here.
First off, I want to thank the leaders that helped put this all together.
You know, Randy and all of the leaders.
Eric will attest that these are not easy events to pull off.
We only did, Eric, what, about 100 of these?
