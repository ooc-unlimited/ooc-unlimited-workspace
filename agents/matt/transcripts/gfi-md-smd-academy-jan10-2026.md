*Transcribed from video (3h49m)*


Open up the champagne, pop, it's my house, come on, turn it up
Hear a knock on the door when the night begins

Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this
Sometimes you gotta stay in, and you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is, sometimes you gotta stay in
Welcome to my house, baby, take control now

We don't have to go around
Duck off the crib to spot the pan
But my house is your house if you throw in the bag
Excuse me if my home, training is sad
Soon as these happy faces ring, you can roll with the cash
Home run, slam dunk, touchdown, bad
Big goss ass, two gosses, so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my class
This is my house, just relax

I refuse to be another member now
Never staying down
This is something real
I'm a name that you'll remember
I'm victorious
It's my time
There's no stopping this
Cause I was homeless
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
I'll be more than just a fable
I'll be written in the stars
I will never be too afraid to plead
Give it all of me
Even when it's hot
Oh, I started as an ember
Who was made for kerosene
And now I'm waging like a fire
Burning up through everything I see
And there goes something like
I'm victorious
It's my time
I'm victorious
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory

If you when you run your own base shop meeting, do you want people to show up to your base
shop meeting without a call without their camera on?
No!
So how about we not do to the company what we want done to us?
Let's have our camera on.
Not having your camera on is like me having a convert or you having a conversation with me
and me texting.
That's what that's like.
You're trying to have a conversation and I'm just texting.
Does that make you feel good or bad?
Bad!
Yeah, I'm not trying to sound like a sheep, but bad.
So my whole point here is this.
Make sure you have your camera on.
Be fully engaged.
This is a three hour short and sweet call.
We're going to be rotating in speakers to equip you and to give you clarity on what you
need to become an agency owner and EMD on this platform.
Why is that such a big deal?
For those of you who don't know, when you become an agency owner with us, you get assigned
contractual ownership, taking ownership of your business.
You own your book of business.
You own your base shop book of business.
If God forbid something happens to you, you have beneficiaries.
You have contingents.
Whatever passive income you build will go on to your family.
It is a rite of passage.
It is a big deal.
And to be very clear, no company in the entire industry has anything close to it.
It all says subject to change without notice.
Our ownership contracts don't say subject to change without notice.
They're contractual.
They're factual and they're designed for you to build something that you could pass on from
one generation to the next.
We've all talked about generational wealth.
We've all heard about generational wealth, but as an EMD, you can build generational income
because you can pass on income from one generation to the next.
That's a massive deal.
And we want to help you step into that role over the first quarter of this year.
And I just want you to know, this is going to be a great year.
You want to know how I know?
Biblically, my wife told me this the other day.
Biblically, 2026 is the year of the harvest.
It's the year of the harvest.
And a lot of you guys have been sowing seeds.
2025 was the year of pruning, cutting out relationships, cutting out negativity, cutting out maybe bad habits
and things we shouldn't have been a part of, right?
2025 was all about pruning.
And 2026 is the year of the harvest.
I want you to know that your harvest is coming.
Your harvest is coming.
As a company, we have a goal to double up in every category, to double up in every category.
We're going to double up in every single category.
But here's the deal.
A lot of you guys are in a position where doubling up would be selling yourself short.
You should be thinking 10X up, 20X up, 30X up.
Some of you guys are at $50,000 in income.
If you 10X, you're going to go $500,000 in income.
I want you to write this down.
My minimum goal for 2025, 2026, my minimum goal for 2026 should be EMD, million point base shop, $500,000 in income.
EMD, million point base shop, half a million dollars in income.
And I want you to write that down.
I want you to get it laminated.
I want you to put that in your shower so every morning and every night you read out loud.
I'm so happy and grateful that I'm an EMD and agency owner with GFI.
I'm so happy and grateful that I ran a million point base shop in the year of 2026.
I'm so happy and grateful that I made a minimum of $500,000 in the year of 2026.
And I want you to declare it, own it, accept it, believe it, talk it, speak it, walk it, act it.
I want you to become it in every single category.
Can we do that?
Yes, yes, yes.
Fantastic.
I know the motto of the company is double up this year, but I want you thinking way far beyond that.
You guys are at a point where if you just double your skill set, you'll double your income.
Arturo, I see you've got the double up hat on.
I love that.
If you just double your skill set, double your recruiting, you will double your income overnight.
So we can go far beyond doubling up this year, I believe, with this group right here.
Hey, drop a one if you're going to hit agency owner and become an EMD within the first six months of this year.
Drop a one.
All right.
Well, just so you know, we're going to be a little box and something at the end of this call where we have a special EMD summit and opportunity to qualify to be a part of that in person.
It's going to be incredible.
So, hey, I just have a couple of a couple of announcements as we get started here today just to kick things off.
And by the way, we're at 546 people on the call today.
And if you could do me a favor once again, if there's someone that you know that's supposed to be on today that is not yet on, the true sign of a leader is how many people they are following.
And so I just want to make sure we have everyone on the call.

The number one thing that we track is attendance.
Attendance, attendance, attendance is always the number one thing that we track.
We have 550 people on.
There's someone that's supposed to be on.
Help us mobilize them because today's going to be a great day.
So that being said, a couple of things that I want to remind you of.
This is a really big deal.
OK, this is a really, really big deal.
We have a 60 day special going on right now with American Equity where we gave up a pay bump a point five one percent.
And that's huge.
OK, we already have the highest and to throw this bump on American Equity.
American Equity is simple, fast, doable, clear.
It's easy to understand.
My entire career, just you guys know, I am at least the beginning parts of my career.
We struggled with annuities.
We struggled with annuities.
It's a more complicated concept.
I was 19, 20 years old when I came into the industry.
And so it was always so complicated.
Now we have so many agents that are coming in and they're learning annuities right away because American Equity, respectfully, is dummy proof.
And what they've done is they simplified the annuity process.
Somebody asked me the other day, is Ethos going to get an annuity program?
I said, we already have one.
They said, what are you talking about?
I said, American Equity.
Right?
They're the ethos of annuities.
It's simple, fast, approved right away.
It's a really big deal.
And we have a special bump in pay.
And I want to encourage you guys to take advantage of it over the next, you know, 55 days, whatever we have left in it.
So let's capitalize on that.
Next thing.
We have the new agent fast start bonus.
New agent fast start bonus.
New agent fast start bonus.
This is huge.
So anybody that got a code number from January 1st on within their first 60 days, if they get their code number, they complete their digital PFR through Teva, which that will be releasing to you guys early this week.
They get three recruits and do three sales within their first 60 days.
They pass their life license and they make their first $1,000.
Anybody that does that is going to get a $500 fast start bonus.
That is huge.
That is huge.
Some of you guys like Matt, why are you telling me this?
If I've already, I'm already an MD and an SMD because an MD and an SMD to get to EMD needs to be thinking, how many people can I get a $500 fast start bonus to?
How many people can I get through the system?
How big can I build my team so I can go become an EMD?
And that's what this does.
It's an incentivized program designed to help you retain your new agents, get your agents off to a fast start.
The most biggest focus that we need to have with our agents is the first 60 days.
The second thing that we have going on is as you guys know, we have just due in January.
We have a special discount of three new directs, three families helps in the month of January and you get a senior associate contract, 50% contract.
And some of you guys will Matt, I'm already an MD and an SMD.
Why does this matter to me?
It matters to you because if you got 10 agents that go focus on three and three this month, you do 30 and 30 and you get out of the base shop and become an EMD.
So you need to be thinking to yourself, yes, I know three and three is not for you.
You're already an MD and SMD.
But what you need to be thinking about is how many people on my team can I get obsessed and focused on three and three?
Because if I have everyone go do three and three, not only will they all get a bump in pay, but you're going to do high volume recruiting, high volume app count, and it will help you get out of the base shop and go become an EMD and an agency owner with us.
So these are some of the different programs that we have going on right now, incentives that we have going on right now.
And I want to encourage you guys to capitalize on it and take advantage of it.
Can we do that?
Yes, yes, yes.
Awesome.
Awesome, awesome, awesome.
So, hey, I'm going to be your host and MC all day today as we bring up the different speakers.
But what I'm so excited about is our first speaker.
I got to bring up Tavares Dove.
Anybody ready to hear from Tavares Dove?
Let me tell you something about T-Dove.
Let me tell you something about T-Dove.
I love this man to death.
I genuinely do.
He's got a heart of gold.
I see the way that he shows up for his family, the way that he shows up as a husband, the way that he shows up as a dad to his kids.
Literally, we have him as the first speaker today because he's taking his son to a basketball game.
And he said, I promised my son I'd be at every single game.
And so he's doing, he's someone that spends every plate, faith, family, finance, fitness, fun.
He's heading our athletic division right now.
He was the number one base shop recruiter last month in the entire company.
He's got a one million plus point base shop, about to be a two million point base shop.
He's about to cross two million points in his base shop.
Top recruiter, top builder, seven figure earner.
If you guys could do me a favor, please give it up for my main man, Mr. Tavares Dove.
All right, all right, all right.
Can you guys hear me and see me?
Okay.
Can you guys hear me and see me?
Okay.
Can we give it up for the greatest field chairman and all the financial services?
Mr. Matthew Welsh did an incredible job, incredible job.
And I hope you guys are pumped up, fired up, super excited.
By the way, I have this wristband on because I was leaving my daughter's track meet, jumped on this call.
My daughter just ran to 55 meters.
She, she just texted me.
She said, Dad, I'm about to do shot put.
I said, okay, all right, I got to do this meeting.
Then I'll be at shot put.
Then I'm going to my son's basketball game.
So it's all good.
So my daughter is a four time junior Olympian and my son, he's a 10th grader, but he's starting varsity and he's averaging about 15 to 18 a game.
And he's super fired up and he's like, Dad, you got to be there.
Cause I kind of coach him from the sidelines.
Like we got to do this.
We got to do that.
And so it's pretty awesome.
And JV as an eighth grader, he averaged 22 points a game.
So he wants to go to Duke university.
So we got some work to do.
So, Hey, real quick, first and foremost, I want to know who I'm talking to.
Am I talking to the next EMDs and all of GFI?
First and foremost, if you are the next EMDs and all of GFI, just give me a five in the chat because you have to embody it.
You have to act like it before you take the promotion.
I want you to hear that clearly.
The promotion won't make you, you make the promotion.
The title doesn't make you, you make the title.
Leadership is not a title.
It's service.
Leadership is not a title.
It's action.
Leadership is not a title.
It's identity.
So if you step into what an EMD is right now.
So I want to stop and back up just a second.
Because I want to read something to you.
We live by the five Fs faith, family, finance, fitness, and fun.
Is that correct?
I want to give you the only thing I'm going to show you today on the screen is this.
Genesis one 26 through 28.
God said, let's make man in our image and our likeness.
And the first thing he said when our heavenly father created us, he said, let them have dominion.
He didn't tell you to participate.
He created you to dominate.
Write that down.
Then I want you to write this down.
Be, do, have.
Let's look at 28.
Be, do, have.
Be, do, have.
And this is going right into my talk.
The first thing he said was be fruitful and multiply.
Fill the earth and subdue it.
So he said, be fruitful, multiply.
That means to add to that means to duplicate your efforts in the earth.
Not just your DNA with your children, but also whatever capacity in which you operate.
In order for Jacob to manifest and grow in the earth, he has to duplicate his efforts and be fruitful and multiply.
And then he said, have dominion.
Don't participate.
Dominate.
Fill the earth and then you'll have the million in the earth.
So here's the point.
If you're fruitful and you're multiplying, if you're filling the earth, then you'll have dominion.
Dominion.
So by the way, there's a guy who recruited over 2000 years ago and he's the greatest recruiter that ever lived.
And this guy's name was Jesus Christ.
Whether you believe in him, like him or not.
He was the greatest recruiter to ever live.
And people are still recruiting for him today.
He went 12 wide, right out the gate.
So right away, he gave us the formula on how to hit EMD, have a million point base shop, how to get to a half a million dollars.
And the first thing was to be fruitful and multiply.
He's number one, number one.
And he said, guess what?
You need to get good at the business and then duplicate your efforts through someone else.
Did you guys hear what I just said?
Will, you need to get fantastic at the business and then teach someone else how to do the same thing.
Adrian, you become phenomenal at the business, then teach someone else to do the same thing.
That's how you be fruitful and multiply.
So you have to get results and then show others how to get results.
So there's three levels of being an EMD.
First of all, number one is that you have the identity of being able to get everything you want.
Then level two is that now you have the identity of helping others get what they want.
And then number three is you have the identity of helping leaders get what they want.
So when you talk about scaling your recruiting, let me ask you a question.
How many of you from the time you started with GFI?
Some of you have been here a year.
Some of you have been here for two years.
Some of you just got promoted to MD or SMD.
Now, here's my question.
Some of you may be at the area you want to accomplish financially.
Some of you may not.
Some of you feel like I'm just getting started.
But have your five F's been improved in one way, shape or form?
If that's you, just put a one in the chat.
Hey, either my faith, my family, my finances, my fitness has all gotten better.
Yes, yes or yes.
If your life has improved the quality of your life, the time with your family.
You actually are having fun.
You're not stressed like corporate America.
Then what you want to share that with as many people as possible.
That's all we do.
We join.
We own.
We share.
Okay, I got started in business.
I own the products and services.
I share it with others.
But then now I look at the experience I'm having.
Now, I want to rebuttal something for just a moment.
Do you always like every aspect of the business?
No.
You don't like every aspect.
Because some people love recruiting.
Some people love building businesses.
And some people are kind of like, oh, I haven't built that muscle yet.
Yes, yes.
Anybody?
Now, let me share something.
There's nothing that you have gotten good at that you weren't horrible at first.
There's nothing in your life that you have gotten good at that you didn't struggle with initially.
Here's the cool part.
You ready, Arturo?
You had to crawl before you walked.
You had to walk before you ran.
Anybody fell off a bike when you learned how to ride a bike the first time?
Am I the only one?
Did you get up and try again?
Did you keep pushing forward?
And then eventually, Julio and Jill, guess what happened?
You eventually learned how to ride a bike and now you can do it with your eyes closed.
Yes or yes?
It's the same way we're building a business.
Some of you say, Coach T, I'm not that good at recruiting.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.

No.










No, you just haven't focused on it.
You just haven't put attention into it.
Because whatever you put absolute focus and attention to, you get good at.
Some of you are like, oh, my goodness, you're right.
I can guarantee you, you say, well, coach, I'm naturally good at production.
Here's my question.
If you look at your schedule right now, how many client appointments do you have in your schedule
and how many hiring recruiting interviews do you have in your schedule?
I guarantee you have more field training and more client presentations on your schedule.
Yes or yes?
But I guarantee if you said, hey, I'm going to make a point to scale my recruiting, to scale my business,
because I understand the business that I am, I'm in.
Let me tell you a quick story.
There's a young lady that's listening in now.
Her name, I'm going to give you three individuals.
The first name is a young lady named Elizabeth Whiteside.
The other name is a lady named Mike Beasley.
And the other lady is a lady named Cheyenne Anderson.
These three ladies.
All three of them have something in common.
Every single one of them got fired from their jobs.
Every single one of them had a little bit of stress at their former careers.
Every single one of them was dealing with some type of politics or corporate, you know, corporate stress.
But then they got recruited into our company.
And all three of them decided, I'm going to make this my career.
And if it's up to, if it's up to be, if it's to be, it's up to me.
That's what they all decided.
Did you know Elizabeth made over $23,000 last month as a, you ready for this?
At 30% contract.
Did you, and she hit marketing director.
Did you know Mike Beasley made over $10,000 last month?
Did you know Cheyenne made over $12,000 last month?
30 days after they got fired and let go, they came in and said, hey, I'm all in.
Let me go take it to another level.
Let me go do it big.
And boom, they did it like that.
So here's the thing.
I want to give you some intangibles.
Number one, if you're going to recruit, you got to study two things.
You got to study human nature and you have to study leadership.
Human nature is how you close.
Leadership is how you move.
A couple of books to study with human nature, of course, is how to win friends and influence people.
One of the greatest human nature books on the planet.
Another book is Skills with People by Les Giblin.
When it comes to leadership, you can look at books like the 21 Irrefutable Laws, a foundational leadership book.
360-degree leader.
Because some of us look at our organization and say, well, I'm not the agency chairman.
I'm not the EMD yet.
I'm not the MVP.
I'm not the SVP.
I'm not the elemental P.
I'm just the MD or SMD.
But you're in the middle.
That means you can influence those, quote unquote, who are at the top and you can influence those who are also getting started in your business.
Here's leadership.
Leadership is about pushing those who came before you up and pulling those who came after you up.
Push and pull.
Push and pull.
Push and pull.
Here's what I found out.
Daniel, you ready for this?
As a leader, when you're pushing others up and pulling others up, the greatest that we have in life is the privilege to serve.
That gives you purpose.
I'll finish up by saying this.
These three C's.
If you study human nature.
If you study leadership.
But then also if you apply these three C's.
Number one, if you make a point to have contact every single day.
You go to the store.
You go to your kids sporting events.
You go get gas.
Make a point just to say hello to anyone who crosses your path.
Just say hello.
Number two is be curious.
Just ask questions.
Hey, you look nice.
That's a nice purse.
Where did you get that from?
Just curious.
You're doing a great job.
Is this something you've always loved to do?
Or did you kind of fall into it?
And then number three is consistency.
Here's what we do when it comes to recruiting.
Number one is we plan it out.
There's a specific time that we take two hours out a day where we're going to have power hour, more like two hours,
where we drive it, push it, make a bunch of phone calls for the sake of adding to our organization.
There's a movie called The Founder.
And what he said in The Founder is, I don't think you understand what business you're in.
I really believe that when people get started here, their entire lives are going to change.
Look at what I just shared with you about Elizabeth Whiteside.
Look at what I shared with you about Maya Beasley, Cheyenne Anderson.
Listen, think about how your life has been impacted.
Better marriages, better faith, better fitness.
And maybe you're not where you want to be financially yet, but when you believe that this thing is real, everything will change.
So look in the mirror.
Say I'm the greatest builder on the planet.
I'm not here to participate.
I'm here to dominate.
And then act like an EMD.
Own it.
And then EMD will come as a byproduct because you already have walked in the identity that you're supposed to be.
Hey, I appreciate you guys.
Thank you so much for your time.
I'm going to turn it back over to our agency chairman, our field chairman, excuse me.
And I appreciate you guys.
You guys have a great time.
Matthew, I'll turn it back over to you, brother.
God bless.
Awesome.
Tavares, what an incredible message, brother.
We appreciate you.
Thank you.
Go enjoy your son's basketball game and track me and pulver and all of it.
You know what I mean?
But hey, I want to double down on some of the things that Tavares has said.
And one thing that was going through my mind as he was speaking about increasing the size of our agency, growing our recruiting, was there's a lot of things that I can invest time into, right?
I can invest money into.
I can invest money into IULs.
I can invest money into Bitcoin.
I can invest money into real estate.
I can invest money into stocks.
I can invest money into a 401k, an IRA, TSP, whatever it might be.
Here's the problem with that is it will never pay you a greater rate of return than investing in people.
It never will.
If I invest $100,000 into the stock market, even if the market is 20%, I go from $100,000 to $120,000.
That's $20,000 in profits, correct?
And then all of a sudden, there's taxes, capital gains, whatever it might be.
But let's just say taxes didn't exist.
I just made $20,000.
I invested $100,000, I made $20,000, correct?
If I invest into developing one person's ability to sell, recruit, build, that could pay me a minimum of $100,000, $150,000, $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 a year in passive income.
So what do you think is a greater investment?
Investing in a 401k or investing in recruiting, investing in people development, investing in other people to help them go on to become successful?
You see how that works?
I just want to be very clear.
As an entrepreneur, I don't think about retirement.
I think about how many people can I help become free?
You with me on this?
Are you catching this right now?
The greatest investment you will ever make is in people.
The problem is if you don't recruit people, how can you invest in them?
One thing I learned from Greg Kapp years ago was that the biggest recruiters always win.
The biggest recruiters always win.
I remember being 19, 20 years old.
I come into the business.
And I'm recruiting a whole bunch of people.
My metrics and my ratios were not very great.
I was in a bad market.
I was in a young market.
I was 19, right?
Everybody said that they had retirement accounts longer than I had been alive.
And so there was a little bit of an uphill battle there when it came to helping people with their finances.
But I was recruiting high volume.
And I went to my leadership.
I said, hey, everybody's talking smack because I recruit, but I'm not earning any income just yet.
And he looks at me and goes, Matt, everyone always says that recruiters don't know how to produce until they finally learn how to produce.
And then they produce more than everyone.
And everyone wonders how they become the top personal producer.
How they start earning so much income.
How are they producing more than everyone else?
Because recruiting breeds skill.
When you have recruiting plus skill, your production spikes, your income spikes, everything spikes.
And so if you can master the art of recruiting, eventually you'll master production.
And when you master production, you'll see big spikes in income because you're doing it at scale versus doing it as an individual.
Does this make sense?
The biggest recruiters always win.
I want you to write this down.
I'm in the business of finding talent.
I'm in the business of finding talent.
Steve Siebold said you can't change someone's level of ambition.
So instead of trying to recruit people and turn them into something they're not, let's run high volume.
Let's find already motivated people versus people we have to motivate.
Let's find already disciplined people versus people that we have to teach to be disciplined.
Let's find people who want to change versus people we have to change.
That all comes down to falling in love with increasing our recruiting volume.
And January is the biggest recruiting month of the year every single year.
Because everyone is in a new year, new me opportunity or mindset right now.
And so since everyone's in a new year, new me mindset, your recruiting should go through the roof in the month of January.
You have an excuse to talk to everyone.
So here's the deal though.
If you're shooting for 10, you're going to land on five.
I want to challenge you that if you want to hit 10 recruits this month in your team, shoot for 25.
If you want to hit 25 recruits this month in your team, shoot for 40.
The reason you don't hit recruiting goals is because you have a recruiting goal that's too low.
If this is your recruiting goal, you got to shoot for here.
If this is your recruiting goal, you got to shoot for here.
I want you to shoot past your recruiting goal and worst case scenario, you will land on it.
Can we make that commitment?
Yes, yes, yes.
Awesome.
Incredible message by Tavares Dove.
Hey, I have the opportunity to bring on our great president, Marty Schaefer right now.
And this company has gotten so much better since this man stepped into it.
His business acumen, his industry knowledge, his industry expertise.
He has brought so much to the plate.
And I know you guys don't necessarily get to see it because you're not working with him every day.
But I'm working with this man on a daily basis.
And to see the knowledge that he has.
We were sitting in a board meeting two days ago in San Jose.
And as I'm sitting there and he was going over a specific strategy on something big that we're trying to do.
I literally, the thought that goes through my mind, this is why he's the president of GFI.
This is an intelligent man.
This is a smart man.
This is a kind man.
This is a respectful man.
This is an integrity driven man.
And he's an absolutely incredible dad to his beautiful girls.
If you guys could do me a favor, please give it up for the greatest president in the history of financial services, Mr. Marty Schaefer.
If you had one shot or one opportunity, he sees everything you ever wanted in one moment.
I knew you'd like this one, Matt.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's all sweating.
Come on, everybody.
You got some of your hands in your body on the sweater already.
Mom's getting nervous.
But on the surface, he looks calm and ready to drop bombs.
Little M&M out of Detroit.
I'm a Midwesterner.
I had to throw a little M&M at you, Matt.
I knew that would get you going.
Great to see everybody.
Great to see everybody.
It's just such an honor to be here today.
Separations are made on Saturdays.
And I did a TikTok post, which I'm new to TikTok.
Matt Schloss has got me on TikTok, which we'll finish talking about that.
But go follow me, mshafer3, and get everybody.
If we got everybody on here to follow me, 660 plus, almost 800 people on here now, that would be awesome.
Matt, I love your message to open.
Tavares' was incredible.
And I'm going to continue this theme here.
And before I get into my content, I want you guys all to know people pay tens of thousands of dollars to get this level of commentary and insight.
You know, it's really, I think you sometimes can get spoiled if you don't recognize what you're hearing.
And I hope to just meet the standard of what has already been shared so far.
So I'm going to talk about recruiting, too.
But I'm going to weave my lens of why I think you should be recruiting so intentionally right now at GFI a little differently through my perspective.
My opening line is you have to recruit yourself first.
Right?
Like, you're here, but are you really here?
Like, do you really, I think Tavares said so well, do you believe, Matt said it, is your identity so firmly planted in the opportunity that we have here at GFI that you literally understand in your core why this is such an extraordinary opportunity?
So my opening bullet is recruit yourself first.
Because if you're not attractive, people won't be attracted to you.
That is so incredibly valuable to remember.
You know, I think if there's so many instances in my professional and personal life where I wanted something to happen, but I hadn't fully embraced the reality of what it meant to go really achieve and tackle that.
And the reason was I didn't believe in myself.
I didn't believe in what I wanted to accomplish before I actually wanted to see the fruits of that labor.
And I have hundreds of instances of that in my life, whether it be these ultra endurance events that I've done that when I thought about it, I was like, I think I can finish that.
I think I can do it.
When I believed I could do it, I did it.
I thought I could become the president of a large financial institution, large financial services company.
But until I truly believed I could do it, none of it happened.
I thought I could make it in the financial services business in 1997.
But I knew I needed to believe I could do it.
Because if I didn't, I couldn't pay my mortgage and take care of my two kids at the time.
So you have to recruit yourself first.
That's my first bulletin point.
And I'm going to talk a little bit about why I think you should have such a strong core belief in what we're doing here.
You know, one of the things that I bring to the marketplace, to GFI, is a near 30-year career in this business.
Now, you know, that's as old as Matt, right?
Like, that's how incredible our field chairman is, is I've been in the business as long as Matt's been alive.
So I think I bring some context to Matt's point around what the marketplace holds.
I've had the distinct privilege and pleasure of knowing most every one of our competitors.
Many of them are personal friends.
They're good people.
And the world and the industry need those organizations.
But they're just not able to fulfill the marketplace the way that we can.
And I think you have to foundationally believe that.
Every person, every SMD and MD that's on here, joining this organization, because they at one point had this glimmer, this flame, this light that they saw in themselves, and they started to gradually unlock that.
What we want to do here today in this meeting, the 10th of January, is unlock those flames.
Completely release any inhibitions you have about why this is the most transformational opportunity in the world, let alone in the financial services marketplace, let alone in the U.S.
In terms of the ability to grow and build a business.
So I look at all of the organizations that I've had the opportunity to go work at.
Many of them have recruited me, continue to try to recruit me.
And I will tell you there's nothing greater than what we have here at GFI.
You know, had I had the opportunity in 1997 to join a platform like GFI, my life has been pretty good.
I've had a lot of success.
But I think I would have been 50, 60, 70 times further along than I am here today.
And so the question you've got to ask yourself is, are you truly committed?
Do you truly believe the way that Tavares spelled it out, the way that Matt spelled it out?
And are your actions concurrent with that level of belief?
I think most of us, if we're being really brutally honest, I think we'd probably say the answer to that is probably no.
So a couple of things I want to encourage all of you to do is to truly do this exercise.
I do this exercise most weeks, if not days, is every day.
And if you if you had a line of sight into my office, into my workspace, you'd see this every day.
I wake up and I aspirationally do auto suggestions around why our organization is the greatest organization in the history of financial services,
why I'm going to be the best president for that organization, why we're going to develop the best leaders in the marketplace,
why we're going to build the best platform, that I am the right person for that job, that you are the right people for that job.
When you live in that reality, that becomes your ability to manifest that reality is is far greater than you could have ever imagined.
You need to understand that, because what we're here to talk to you all about, to pour into every one of you,
is how you need to see and view and become the better version of yourself.
Ultimately, we're trying to get you to that next benchmark of executive marketing director where you truly own your business
and you truly start to unlock this path to partnership, which is the greatest opportunity to build truly transformational wealth,
not for wealth's sake, but in my opinion, in terms of being able to help millions of people.
When I think of the financial services space, and I want you to follow this analogy or this business example as an example.
I live in Dallas proper.
I uprooted my life in Denver, Colorado with these beautiful mountains and a place that I love, and I moved to Dallas, Texas.
But in Dallas, Texas, we've got several hundred agents.
I want you to think about Dallas, Texas, just as a microcosm of the opportunity in financial services.
In Dallas proper, there's probably six, seven million people in Dallas proper alone.
In Dallas proper alone.
And we have a marketplace where people want to talk about why I'm better or why this is better.
There is an ocean of opportunity out there.
And Dallas is just one microcosm of that.
If we grew to, there is the ability in Dallas, Texas alone to grow to two, three, four million agents.
In Dallas, Texas alone.
Imagine if we had in Dallas, and I know we have some amazing leaders here.
I was just with Armando and his team the other night at dinner.
Imagine if they all believed the way that I'm describing.
And again, I believe they had that message delivered to them at dinner the other night.
And they went out and quadrupled their recruiting.
And we grew to 1,000, 5,000, 10,000.
And then we get that multiplier effect.
That's the level of belief and growth that we need to have.
Because there are more clients that need to be served than we as an industry can help.
And the only way we get there is through you recruiting yourself and then ultimately believing at a level that you can go out and recruit hundreds, if not thousands, of people into this business.
We need to go find the next Matt Welsh.
We need to go find the next Eric Olson.
We need to go find the next Tavaro Stubb, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, why do I think, you know, let me get a little bit more tactical around why I think financial services is this amazing ocean of opportunity.
But let me tell you why I believe that GFI is the best platform in the world.
Number one, the fact that we have the fulfillment formula.
You know, many of you know my background.
You know, I've worked in corporate America.
I've worked in startups.
I've worked in technology companies.
I've seen it all.
And the facts remain that never in my career could I ever talk about faith.
Never in my career could somebody have opened up a call and thrown up a biblical quote like Tavares Duff just did and not be reprimanded or concerned or HR would have been called or something concerning would have happened.
Never in my career.
Never in my career.

Never in my career.

Never in my career.

You have the ability to bring that to people.
Greg Capp says it so eloquently.
He's like, what's the worst thing that could happen to somebody?
They could spend $199 and they become a better father, better, better mother.
They get more connected to their faith.
I mean, Matt Schloss is an incredible example of who I'm doing the tick tock with on Monday.
You know, Matt was a nonbeliever his whole life.
And I got to watch him get baptized.
For $199.
And by the way, he does pretty well as well.
So our fulfillment formula.
The fact that we're fully independent.
Do you guys know how powerful that is that Eric doesn't have to, you know, Eric Olson is an absolute unicorn.
The fact that this man, I want you to process this and I want you to think if any of you would have done this.
He worked for 22 plus years, saved millions and millions of dollars and took all of that, walked away from everything that he had and gave all of those years, 20, almost 25 years of work into this company to create the greatest platform for all of you.
For me.
You know, I don't sit here as the president of GFI if Eric doesn't make that belief to recruit himself to become the first CEO of GFI after Sandra.
And then ultimately believe so much so that he brought 50 of his best friends that he's had for a quarter century to GFI.
That's incredible.
And I'm going to use one example.
I don't know if he's on here or not, but if Matt Yance is on here, he should he should comment in the chat.
But in my 29 years, I've never recruited Matt into any business I've been in.
Now, Matt and I grew up kindergarten, best friends and graduated college as roommates.
I'm the godfather to his youngest and only son and Matt, after 29 years of watching me in the business, joined GFI.
This is different.
What we're doing is different.
The fact that we're independent, the fact that Eric poured 50 million dollars of his own money to build the greatest independent platform in the history of financial services, you should be incredibly proud of.
And you should believe in both yourself in this opportunity.
The fact that we have no debt, we have no investors, we have direct carrier contracts.
What we have here is special, not just because of the fulfillment, but because we've created a platform that's unlike anything that exists in the marketplace.
The leadership development that we do.
You know, I've been around some incredible organizations, all of the icons of the industry.
Most all of them are friends of mine.
And I would put our stack of leaders up against any of them.
And I think we multiply their ability to lead beyond measure.
And we need you to believe I am the next leader.
You need to see that and ultimately manifest that by taking action after today.
Because whatever you were yesterday is irrelevant.
Whatever you whatever you're going to become tomorrow is completely up to you.
All you have is who you are today.
You can have bad minutes, you can have bad hours, but you can't have bad days.
So give yourself grace and just know that you have way more in you than you think you're capable of.
And this platform, this this opportunity is your ability to unlock that for you and your families.
That leads me to my most important point, I think, as it relates to why I think I've had such a successful career.
You know, for those of you who don't know, I grew up in a small town, Springfield, Ohio.
If anybody's from Springfield, throw it in the chat.
I'd love I'd love to connect with any Springfield, Ohio wins the home of John Legend and Dave Chappelle.
You know, I grew up with no reality like what I currently have.
You know, I was one of five.
My dad was a welder.
My brother still lives back home.
Everybody in my family either went to work at the International Harvester plant there or the Honda plant there or work at a steel mill.
But I was lucky enough to have been given the God given talent of believing in myself.
And that was instilled in me by my parents.
And it enabled me to take really big bets on myself.
And none of the great accomplishments that I've had would have ever happened had I not recruited myself to whatever that opportunity was first.
Believe that I was going to achieve it as if it had already been achieved and take the necessary actions to make that a reality.
So many of you are successful, but you're at the precipice of this next level of yourself.
So I want to challenge all of you to understand that in this in this country, this amazing country that we have, you have the ability for you.
You've unlocked the ability for one hundred ninety nine dollars and some negligible negligible costs associated with starting up your business.
To be participants in the greatest wealth transfer in the history of humanity, let alone our country.
You have the greatest wealth transfer occurring in the history of humanity.
There are tens and hundreds of millions of people who need the products and services that we provide.
And we have an unlimited supply of people that we can talk to about this opportunity.
And as I unwind every business problem we have and Matt knows this Mario knows this Eric knows this Greg cap tells me this.
He's like, I always tell you this Marty.
The number one objective we have the only way we double up in 2026.
I've got my double up bracelet.
On that Eric gave me the only way we double up is it begins and ends with recruiting.
It's I want to challenge every person on this call to think bigger, take bolder bets, write down your plans, execute the plans.
When you fail, get your get your butt back up and go at it again, because it's not easy.
The hustle sold separately, as Eric says.
So I just want to challenge everybody to think bigger, believe faster and take immediate action to unlock the potential this opportunity has and holds for all of you.
And I will just tell you, and I'll close on this 29 years of my career, 29 incredible years of my career.
I've been involved in three enormous startups.
I've seen those startups be wildly successful up to and including the most recent S1 filing of ethos that they're going to be IPO in probably the next 60 days.
Nothing even remotely close comes to what we're doing in building here at GFI.
And you are the tip of the spear without you.
None of this happens without all of you executing with an obsessive level.
None of it happens without you going out there and executing the fulfillment formula, going out there and telling people how much you believe in this opportunity because you've seen it change lives.
We need to do that.
We need to do that at a level that's never been seen before.
And we need to do it the right way, because that's the only way that we can live our true fulfillment, which is doing the business the right way.
There are millions of people that need you, need us and need this opportunity more than ever.
So I want to thank all of you for everything you do every day.
What you do is hard.
I've been in that role.
I believe in every one of you, and I want to see all of your aspirational dreams come true.
Now, hopefully, Matt has figured out how to share the Tick Tock that Matt Schloss and I are going to be doing on Monday.
I'm not a Tick Tock guy.
I'm not a Tick Tock guy.
But I will tell you, I need a thousand followers.
I need to do 30 live Tick Tock videos for Monday, Matt.
So if I can get every person on this call to go follow M Schaefer three on Tick Tock, that would be amazing.
If I could get 10,000 followers, it would be awesome because Matt Schloss and I are going to talk about our opportunity.
All the haters are going to be on.
All the haters are going to be on.
So let's give them a show, as Eric always says.
So I cannot wait to share our value proposition with the whole world on Monday at 6 p.m. Pacific time.
And many of you, I'd love to have all of it Monday.
And if Matt convinces me, we'll do this several times.
So with that, my friend, Matthew, the best field chairman and somebody who I said this to Eric the other day.
I can't even imagine being where Matt is at 30.
He truly is one of the greatest leaders.
He's one of the greatest leaders.
He's one of the greatest leaders.
He's one of the greatest leaders.
He's one of the greatest leaders.
He's one of the greatest leaders.
He's one of the greatest leaders.
He's one of the greatest leaders.
in our industry's history, let alone our company.
And so you guys are all blessed
to have a field chairman like Matt Welsh,
incredible father, incredible spouse, incredible leader.
Everything this guy touches turns to gold.
So I want to thank you, Matt, for all of your leadership.
And I want to thank everybody for everything you're going to do
to make 2026 the year that we double up.
Thanks, everybody.
Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.
Marty, unbelievable call.
And guys, go follow Marty on TikTok.
I don't even think Marty knew how to spell TikTok before.
I don't even have.
I especially explained it.
Oh, I love it.
What an incredible message.
What I love that he said, I thought this was so powerful,
is that before you go recruit others, you have to recruit yourself.
And some of you guys are like, oh, what do you mean?
I already got a code number.
That doesn't mean you're recruited.
That doesn't mean you're recruited.
That doesn't mean you're all in.
That doesn't mean that this is everything that you do.
That doesn't mean that you believe with your heart and soul.
This doesn't mean that you're locked in.
I want to challenge you to recruit yourself.
Recruit yourself to being someone that doesn't have quit in them.
Recruit yourself to being somebody that believes in the opportunity.
Recruit yourself to be somebody that can't be distracted because you believe so much in your cause.
You know, they say those who believe will be believed,
and those who are convinced will be convincing.
So when people look at all the big recruiters,
do you know that what separates the big recruiters from the small recruiters?
It's their belief system.
Those who believe will be believed,
and those who are convinced will be convincing.
I want to challenge you to believe more.
I want to challenge you to convince yourself to be more all in.
There's a different level of all in.
There's a different level of all in,
and I want to challenge you to tap into that.
People always say, Matt, what is influence?
Influence is I believe that you believe what you're saying.
That's influence.
I believe that you believe what you're saying.
So if you want to increase your influence as you're trying to build your agency,
if you want to increase your influence as you take people through the system,
if you want to increase your influence as you sit down with clients,
there's got to be that thought of,
I believe this so much that there's nothing that you could ever say
to get me to doubt my belief in this opportunity, this company,
what we do for our clients,
the difference we make in our agents' lives.
You can't influence me out of that.
Influence is I believe that you believe what you're saying,
and I want to challenge you to recruit yourself like what Marty talked about.
That was so good.
I love it.
Thank you, Marty.
Greatest president in the history of financial services.
Now I get to bring up the greatest CEO that our industry has ever seen.
Guys, it's, you look at any other company out there,
they just bring in a random CEO that knows how to operate a business,
but they have no idea how to recruit.
They have no idea how to build.
They have no idea what it's like to run a base shop.
They have no idea what it's like to sell a life insurance policy.
They have no idea what it's like to have people quit on them.
They have no idea what it's like to build something,
to promote an EMD.
They don't know what that's like.
And the fact that we have a CEO that not only,
from an industry understanding,
it's bar none,
there's no one like him because of his obsession with getting better each and
every single day.
He's probably learned more in the last 12 months with how obsessed he is than
any other person has in our industry over the last 20,
30 years,
because most people are not as obsessed as this man.
Nobody's as obsessed as this man when it comes to growing and getting better.
So they have each and every single one of us,
the greatest opportunity this industry has ever seen.
But what separates our leadership as well is the fact that Eric has promoted
104 direct EMDs.
He ran,
as we transitioned to GFI,
a 3 million point base shop.
He's done a million personal points in one month.
We have somebody operating our company,
running our company that knows exactly what it's like to be in someone's base
shop and have to go do the requirements to get out of a base shop and then
knows what it's like to build a base shop to then promote EMDs out of that
base shop.
He knows exactly what we're all going through.
No other company has that.
And it's a separator.
And the fact that he's a humble man,
the fact that he's the family man,
the fact that he's a man of faith,
a great dad,
a great husband,
and a leader that genuinely cares about his people.
We are truly so blessed to have him running and operating this company and
leading this company.
If you guys could do me a favor and please give it up for my mentor,
the greatest coach in the business,
the greatest CEO in the industry,
Mr.
Eric Olson.
All right,
champions.
Good to see you.
Are these the next agency owners in GFI?
Raise your hand if these are the next agency owners in GFI.
Yes.
All right.
Well,
great to see everybody.
What an amazing day so far.
Oh my goodness.
I'm listening to Matt Welsh and Tavares Dove and Marty Schaefer and I'm fired up.
Man,
I want to go on my EMD run right now.
You know,
this is pretty exciting.
So congratulations for being invited to be on here today.
You guys are the best of the best.
You are the next big leaders in GFI.
I want you to know that when I started in the financial industry,
when I was 21 years old,
back in May of 2003,
I wanted to be somebody.
I wanted to do something big.
And I was just like,
man,
I hope they know who I am.
I hope they can know my name.
I want to be the next leader.
So I want you to know you guys are the next rising stars.
You guys are the next rising leaders in GFI,
which is a huge deal,
by the way,
back in my practice company,
you guys,
cause now in GFI,
you're at 60,
70% contracts,
full 100% advances.
Back in the day,
when I was a EMD,
we were at 60% contracts with 50% advances.
And I was still making,
you know,
between 250 and 500 a year at age 22,
23,
24.
So the point is a lot of you guys are going to go make a half a million
dollars this year.
Some of you are going to make a quarter million this year.
Some of you are going to make 750 this year.
Some of you are going to make a million this year.
When you hit EMD,
we just had an EMD in GFI make $700,000,
right?
Just last year,
first year as a brand new EMD makes 700.
So who's going to be that next rising leader in GFI?
Who am I looking at?
Who are the next big rising leaders,
the big next rising stars?
Maybe you're like me.
I want people to know who I am.
Well,
guess what?
We decided to do a leadership Academy for our next rising leaders,
our next EMDs,
our next agency owners.
And that's all of you.
So you are the chosen one.
You are the selected one.
And it's an honor and a privilege for my wife,
Sandra and I to be in business with all of you,
because this is not our company.
This is our company.
We want partners.
We want senior partners.
We want junior partners.
We want inner circle members and agency owners,
a part of GFI,
and we're going to spread the wealth.
So I have a couple of points for you today.
I don't have a lot of time because we have a lot of great speakers.
My challenge to you is get one golden nugget from every speaker.
Does that make sense?
Right?
Get one golden nugget from every speaker.
What's your golden nugget from Matt Wells?
What's your golden nugget from Tavares Doug?
What's your golden nugget from myself, from Marty?
And then obviously we have a power lady speaking next and Megan,
which is incredible.
So, you know, with every company, with every hospital,
with every sports team, with every church,
all success rises and falls on leadership.
All success rises and falls on leadership.
And what I'm very proud of in GFI is we have the best leadership team
in the history of financial services, both on the field side
and the field board and the home office executive board.
And together we're on the same page because we are a field-led company,
but we are home office supported at the exact same time.
So a couple of things I want to start with.
Number one, 30-30-30.
Have you heard that before?
30-30-30.
By 2030, GFI will be a $30 billion company.
How are we going to do that?
With a 30 times multiple.
How are we going to do that?
Teva Technologies.
I am so excited and fired up about Teva Technologies.
We've been thinking about it for a couple years.
We've been planning it the last several years.
We've been working on it the last year plus.
I wish I had something like Teva Technologies the last 23 years,
but I didn't.
And if you ask me,
how did I go from a million dollars a year in my 20s in income
to a million dollars a month in my 30s in income?
It was because of the business ratio.
So I want you to write this down.
In GFI, we have 12 different business ratios.
We have 12 different business metrics.
And you, as a leader,
are supposed to inspect what you expect
because when performance is measured,
performance is improved.
You're supposed to track it and attack it
and treat this business like a real business
because you are a real business owner.
You're an entrepreneur.
GFI is an entrepreneurship movement.
And so you've got to act and walk and talk
and look and dress like a CEO
before you can become a CEO.
Because remember,
we have the greatest equity program
in the history of financial services,
which is called the POP program,
POP, the Partnership Ownership Program.
It just went live officially a couple months ago.
It's the best thing that's ever been started
in financial services.
Marty Schaefer, our great president,
said it's the first ever virtuous equity pay cycle
in the history of financial services.
And it's basically,
God takes care of GFI,
GFI takes care of its senior partners,
minimum top 100 senior partners.
The senior partners takes care of the junior partners,
which is our inner circle members,
which is top 1,000.
And then the inner circle top 1,000
takes care of our EMDs and agency owners,
which are top 10,000.
And then the top 10,000
take care of their mother-in-law
for watching the kids while they were building.
Does that make sense?
Right?
My mother-in-law is here right now
with our two littlest ones are six.
So she's here watching the kids.
And it's just, you know,
the virtuous equity pay cycle.
We have a plan to go public
in the next five years by 2030.
It's the greatest wealth transfer
happening in the history of financial services
going on right now.
I live in San Jose, California, Silicon Valley.
It's the land of the startups.
It's the land of technology.
It's the land of big, big, big companies going public.
NVIDIA is in my backyard.
They just became a $5 trillion company.
Apple, DoorDash, Zoom, Netflix.
You heard of some of these companies?
These are all my backyard.
These are companies that are now
hundreds of billions of dollars
and trillion dollar companies.
And we're doing the exact same thing.
And we just hit the two year mark.
By the way, two years ago,
when we started, people said,
I'm not going to come over to GFI
until two years.
I'm not going to come over and tell
because the first two years is the hardest.
Well, guess what?
We've solved that.
We got through the two years.
Our business is exploding.
We are on fire in every single way.
Things are a hundred times better
than I even thought.
And that just shows we are a faith-based company.
If God is for you, who could be against you?
GFI is global financial impact.
But really in my heart,
GFI is God's favorite individuals.
And when God is overseeing
and looking over this company,
you can't be stopped.
Let me just tell you, look in my eyes.
This is going a hundred times better
than I thought it was going to be.
GFI is incredible.
GFI just got evaluated at $1.2 billion with a B.
We're going to be a $30 billion company
probably in the next three years, right?
Someone just told me,
Eric, you're thinking too small.
All these companies are talking
about trillion dollar companies.
What do you mean 30 billion?
That's going to be the next couple of years.
Because remember,
that's only 1 billion a year
times a 30 times multiple.
That's a $30 billion company.
That'll happen the last couple of years.
This year we'll do 400 million already, right?
Already we'll do 400 million this year in 2026.
So are you kidding me?
I'm getting chills just thinking about it.
But you got to have the energy.
You got to have the belief.
You got to have the conviction.
You got to have the certainty.
You got to have the fire in their belly.
People are like, they're scared.
They should be.
We're the fastest growing company in the world.
We just hit 56,000 new associates yesterday.
Are you kidding me?
They're watching.
Of course they're watching.
Let's give them a show.
Did you notice that we went to the NASDAQ
and all of a sudden other companies
started trying to go to the NASDAQ?
And then we went to the New York Stock Exchange
and all of a sudden other people
tried to go to the New York Stock Exchange.
And like we built a hybrid business model.
Now other people are talking about
the hybrid business model.
Isn't that cute?
Aren't they so cute?
Are you kidding me?
That's why they just fired their president,
by the way.
Did you hear that?
They just fired their president a couple of days ago.
Wow.
Because GFI is on the map, baby.
They didn't just fire their president
at my practice company.
They fired his boss too.
Wow.
That's GFI.
That's the GFI effect.
We are out there.
We'll be number one in the industry.
30-30-30 is absolutely going to happen.
With or without you, by the way.
Just to be clear.
With or without you.
But I hope it's with you.
I hope you buy into the vision.
I hope you meet us halfway.
Because if you meet us halfway,
we will take you to the very, very top
of the entire company,
of the entire industry,
and we're going to share the wealth.
Out of this 30 billion,
I just need one.
I just need one of those.
The other 29,
boom, we're sharing it with everybody else.
Is that okay with you?
Man, I'm fired up.
Right?
I'm fired up.
The only way for you to be successful
is to be all in.
Someone just said it.
Right?
Be all in.
If you want to be all in,
you got to be all in.
Simple as that.
Good.
So,
vision 30-30-30.
So, that's why you got to be fired up
about Teva Technologies.
That's how we're going to get
our 30 times multiple.
And so, back to the 12 business ratios.
If you want to know,
how'd you go from a million a year
in your 20s
to a million a month in my 30s?
And now I'm in my early 40s.
And so, guess what?
Here's how I did it.
I tracked and attacked
and inspected what I expected
and performance is measured,
performance is improved every day
looking at the business ratios.
And there are 12 different business ratios
that you should be tracking in GFI.
And Matt Welsh is going to go over
that PowerPoint at the end.
We also have a contest
that we're launching at the end.
So, please stay to the very end today.
We will give you those 12 business ratios
so you can take a picture of it.
We will also launch the contest
for you to be the next EMD.
We're launching that all at the end today
at about 1130 Pacific time.
So, make sure you're on till the end.
Champions stay till the end.
But on Teva Technologies,
we invested millions and millions
and millions of dollars
to start up this FinTech platform.
But right there on the front page,
you can look at
your recruit to license ratio,
your license to net license ratio,
your revenue per agent ratios,
your persistency gross points
versus net points ratios.
Everything is right there.
So, if you look at that every single day,
track it and attack it,
you will double or triple your income
this year in GFI.
True story.
I'm talking about making an extra
$100,000, $200,000, $300,000 this year.
By the way, go to TevaTech,
Tevatechnologies.com.
Go to the website, Tevatech.com.
Look at your website
and you can put on there,
okay, January 2024
to January 2026,
the last 24 months in GFI.
And then you can see
on your super team
between your entire team,
how much in chargebacks total
in the last 24 months.
We did this yesterday
with one of our power ladies
in our company.
She's in Texas.
And it said she had $600,000
in chargebacks
between personal,
base shop,
super base,
super team,
all of her leaders all together.
She's making over half a million a year.
She's a one percenter.
She's awesome.
But in the last 24 months,
she had 600,000 in chargebacks.
I said, all you got to do
is click on the button
and now shows all the 71 clients
you got to call
and you call every single one
of those 71 clients
and get the business
back on the books.
And now we have new companies.
We have new carriers.
We have new products.
We have better companies.
We have better carriers.
We have better products.
We have the best companies,
best carriers,
best partners
in the entire financial industry.
We really do
with North American
and Allianz
and F&G
and FloorBridge
and Augustar
and Mutual of Omaha
and Ethos
and Quility
and American Equity,
like the best of the best of the best.
We really do.
So you can call
every single one of those clients
and get them back on the books.
Just right there,
that will save you.
I mean, literally,
save you a ton of money
and make you a ton of money.
So please be fired up
and excited about Teva Technologies.
I want you to go to Teva Technologies
every single day.
I want you to be on TevaTech.com
more than you're on Instagram,
more than you're on TikTok,
more than you're on Facebook,
more than you're on your phone, right?
Looking at this website,
making sure that you treat this
like a real business
because it is a real business.
By the way,
if you want to be a partner of GFI,
you got to start acting
like a partner of GFI, right?
How do we make GFI better?
How do I get my persistency up?
How do I recruit more people?
How do I bring more value?
I love being around people
who bring value to GFI.
Matthew Welsh,
Tavares Dove,
Marty Schaefer,
they bring a lot of value to GFI.
That's why they're speaking today.
Does that make sense?
Right?
So you got to be thinking about
what value can I bring to GFI
because givers gain.
Givers gain.
Simple as that.
All right.
Next thing.
So you've heard the vision 30-30.
How are we going to become
a $30 billion company
by 2030?
Three things.
Buy into the vision,
number one.
Number two,
you got to grow,
grow,
grow,
grow.
Recruit,
build,
lead,
and compete.
You got to explode your business.
10X your team.
Recruit,
build,
lead,
and compete.
Grow this organization.
We want to go recruit
a million people.
We're already at 56,000 agents.
We want to go to 100,000 agents
this year.
Like true story.
That's number two.
We got to grow.
And number three
is Teva Technologies.
So vision,
growth,
and Teva.
Vision,
growth,
and Teva.
Teva.
Buy into the vision,
grow the company,
use technology.
Vision,
growth,
and Teva.
We on the same page?
Good.
So what do you need
to go all in with?
Maybe like Marty said,
you got to recruit yourself,
buy into the vision.
Maybe you need to start
recruiting and growing
your team.
Or maybe you need to
buy into Teva Technologies.
But those three things
together
are going to help us
hit our goal
of going public
by 2030.
Make sense?
Good.
Next thing.
By the way,
in the Bible,
it says if the leader
has no vision,
the people will perish.
And we are not going
to perish.
We are going to explode
and we're going to do this.
All right?
Number two.
The next thing is
you got to make
a big decision.
And if you make
a big decision,
that will lead
to big results.
This is a big event
today on Zoom,
our Leadership Academy,
all of our best MDs,
all of our best SMDs.
We're training them
to be the next EMDs,
the next agency owners.
And so, you know,
this is a big event.
And big decisions
are made at big events.
You can't change people,
but you can bring people
to life-changing events.
So by 12 noon today,
12 noon Pacific time today,
what big decision
can you make?
Maybe you make a decision
to go all out
the next 90 days.
By the way,
huge announcement.
The last two years,
you could only hit EMD
in 12 months
or six months.
Officially today,
you can now hit EMD
the next three months.
You can do it January,
February, March.
That's a huge announcement.
That's a huge deal.
That's very exciting.
Before, you had to wait 12 months.
Before, you had to wait six months.
Now, you can do it in three months.
So by the end of the first quarter
of 2026,
March 31st,
you could be an EMD.
You could be an Executive
Marketing Director.
You could be at the highest contract.
You could be getting
monthly bonus pools.
You could be getting
ownership of your company
as an agency owner EMD
by March 31st.
Seriously,
I want you to do that.
Adrian Montanez,
it's your time.
Robert Wooden,
it's your time.
Stacey Cannon,
it's your time.
Anthony Durante,
it's your time.
The time is now.
Jacob Forston,
it's time.
Sophia,
you got to make this happen.
Jennifer,
let's go.
Fernanda,
let's go.
It's your time,
Austin.
Let's go make it happen.
So March 31st,
you need to become an EMD.
That's my challenge to you.
That's my goal for you.
Before Q2,
before April 1st,
I'm going to become an EMD.
If you believe
you could be an EMD
by the end of quarter one,
by March 31st,
I want you to put in the chat,
I'm the next EMD.
I'm the next EMD.
I'm the next EMD.
If you believe
you could be an EMD
by March 31st,
2026,
put in the chat,
I'm the next EMD.
And here's the deal.
Don't just tell me something
and not do it.
You got to do it.
You got to go make it happen.
I'm not the best at everything.
I'm not the best at everything.
Period.
If I say something,
it's going to happen.
You ever notice
I never said
I'm going to get a six pack?
I never said that.
You know why?
That's been a little harder for me.
That's been a little harder for me.
Right?
But guess what?
Anything else,
if I say it,
I'm going to do it.
Right?
Simple as that.
Bottom line.
And so you need
to be an EMB
by March 31st.
You need to be an EMB
by March 31st.
And a bunch of you,
Casey,
Kaylin,
Cecilia,
Manuel,
Lupita,
Jonathan,
you're going to go make it happen.
Nikki,
let's go.
If it is to be,
it's up to me.
Let's go.
I don't just have confidence.
I have confidence.
You got to have some confidence
in yourself.
By the way,
anybody can do anything
for 90 days.
Anybody can do anything
for 90 days.
Right?
You can go all out.
You only got 80 days left.
Today's the 10th.
Today's the 10th.
You go all out for 80 days.
You should write that in your notes.
All out for 80 days.
All out for 80 days.
All out for 80 days.
Big decisions lead to big results.
Anyone can do anything
for 90 days.
Next one.
Everybody does better
with a deadline.
Everybody does better
with a deadline.
Your deadline is March 31st.
Your deadline is March 31st.
I'm going to go all out,
all in,
80 days,
March 31st.
Boom.
I'm going to win the contest
that Matt's going to talk about
at the end today.
I'm going to be going
to this next trip,
this next event in May
in San Diego, California.
I'll be there,
but you got to go all out
the next 80 days.
All out the next 80 days.
You can do anything
that you put your mind to.
If it is to be,
it's up to me.
Pray like it's up to God,
but work like it's up to me.
Simple as that.
You got what it takes.
Here's another thing.
Greg Kapp,
our great agency chairman,
my mentor,
my father figure,
the godfather of my son.
My son's five months old today.
He was born on the 10th,
you know,
because the 10 DDR,
double digits, right?
It's all about DDR.
But Greg Kapp said,
there's an angel on one shoulder.
There's a devil on one shoulder.
There's someone who works hard
on one shoulder.
There's a guy or lady
who doesn't work enough,
you know,
too hard on the other shoulder.
There's someone who believes
and someone who doesn't believe.
I want to challenge you
the next 80 days.
Say,
I got this.
I have what it takes.
I can do this.
I'm going to go all out.
I'm going to give my best.
I'm not going to give excuses.
My reasons are bigger
than my excuses.
Simple as that.
But everyone does better
with a deadline
and your deadline
is March 31st.
I was looking at Matt Welsh's announcement
this morning at 9 a.m.
We're giving $500 fast start bonus
to all the new people.
We're giving people
a big raise and pay
all the way up to 50% contract
with 3,330.
We just raised the comp
on American Equity annuities.
We have 14 different
platinum companies.
We're doing the very best thing
for the client
every single time.
The very best thing
for the agent
every single time.
We have this Hawaii trip
happening right now.
So many great things
happening in GFI.
And now you can hit EMD
in three months.
You don't got to wait
six months to hit EMD.
And I want to give
my brother Mario Bayona
a big shout out
because Mario Bayona
is the one that said,
you know what?
Let's just do it
in three months, right?
Let's do a run.
Let's go hard.
And that's what we did.
Mario's on the board.
He had a great idea.
We ran with that.
And I think we're going
to double, triple,
quadruple
the amount of EMDs
and agency owners
that we pop out
the next couple months.
Very, very exciting.
Next thing I'll say
is you heard
the 30-30-30
of our vision
for the company
to go public, right?
But here's another one.
30-30-30.
Activity leads to results.
Activity leads to results.
30-30-30.
By the way,
this is what I've done
for 20 plus years.
It's called 30-30-30.
You used to hear it.
If you heard me speak before,
I used to call it
5-5-50.
5-5-50.
5-5-50.
5-5-50.
5 prospects a day.
5 appointments a day.
50 calls a day.
Right?
You guys have heard that?
Right?
So here's 30-30-30
in another form.
30 new prospects
per day.
Okay?
30 new,
I'm sorry,
30 new prospects
per week.
So 30-30-30
is now per week.
So 30 prospects
per week.
30 appointments
per week.
Right?
Minimum.
Okay?
And then you've got to be
doing 30 calls a day.
Okay?
So 30-30-30.
30 prospects a week.
30 calls a day.
30 appointments a week.
One more time.
30-30-30.
30 prospects a week.
30 calls a day.
30 appointments a week.
If you do 30 appointments a week,
I'm telling you,
you're going to be EMD
the next three months.
30 appointments a week.
Guess what I did?
5-5-50.
5 prospects a day.
5 appointments a day.
50 calls a day.
I did that for 20 years.
It works.
Because the more activity
you generate,
the more results
you're going to get.
Simple as that.
Right?
So your goal.
So like if you ask me,
okay, Eric,
I know there's
a hundred different ways
I could be EMD
by March 31st.
There's a hundred different ways
I could be agency owner
by March 31st.
What's the number one thing
I got to do?
Number one,
do more appointments
than you've ever done
in your life?
Like that's the truth.
Does that make sense?
Whoever goes on
the most appointments wins.
You got to do
more appointments per day,
more appointments per week,
more appointments per month
than you've ever done
in your life
the next 80 days.
You got to be on it.
You got to be after it.
You got to be snapping necks
and cashing checks.
You got to be up early.
You got to go to bed late.
You got to be making it happen.
Right?
You got to be on your A game.
How do you go from A player
to A plus player?
You got to have a family meeting.
Say,
I got 80 days.
I'm going to become
a senior broker.
I'm going to become
an executive marketing director.
I'm going to become
an agency owner.
I'm going to be
at the highest contract possible.
I'm going to get
real ownership
of my company.
I'm going to be
in monthly bonus pools.
I'm going to get invited
to special events
and special trips.
I need to go all out.
You got 80 days.
By the way,
it's worth it.
It's totally worth it
because once you're EMB,
you're going to stay EMB
and agency owner
for the next 20 plus years.
And then when you pass away,
it goes to your loved ones.
So let me ask you a question.
Are you willing to go all out
the next 80 days
to change your last name
for the next 80 years?
Wow, wow, wow.
Let me say it again
for those of you in the back.
For those of you in the back.
Okay?
Are you willing to go all out
the next 80 days
so you can change your legacy
and change your last name
for the next 80 years?
I hope the answer is yes.
I hope the answer is yes.
By the way,
what did you do
the last 80 days?
What did you do
the last 80 days
that were so life-changing,
that were so critical,
that were so amazing,
that were so incredible
that you couldn't
have been an EMB?
Think about it.
Probably nothing.
So guess what?
The next 80 days
are going to go by super fast.
The next 80 days
are going to go by
super fast anyways.
You might as well get after it.
You might as well
make it happen.
Some of you that knew me
in Pinnacle,
I used to run an organization
called Pinnacle for 20 years
and some of you guys were there
and I worked pretty hard.
I always said,
I work half days,
12 hours a day.
I work half days,
12 hours a day.
The other 12 hours,
I do whatever I want,
but 12 hours a day,
I'm after it.
And I did that for 20 years
and we're doing 300 million
a year in life premium
and 1.2 billion
in annuity business
and we had 25,000 licensed agents
and I'm making a million a month
and things were good.
But guess what?
I'm now working
double and triple
than I've ever worked.
Honestly,
100%.
I'm working double,
triple than I've ever worked.
I'm after it.
I'm up at 4 a.m.
I'm up later.
I'm up earlier.
I'm traveling.
I'm making it happen.
I'm on the phone.
I got 13 appointments today.
13.
13.















































appointments today. I've already had four appointments this morning, right? Like I'm after
it. You got to do the same thing. You got what it takes. We believe in you. That's why you're on
here. You have what it takes. Let me ask you a question. What if everything in your life has
prepared you for this moment right here? What if everything you've done in your life has prepared
you for this moment right here? The good, the bad, the ugly, the past job, the past career,
the past business, the ex, the ex boss, the ex whatever. Everything has prepared you for this
moment. You got to believe that because the two most important days in your life are the day you
were born and the day you figure out why. Greg Kapp, my mentor, our agency chairman, he said, Eric, he said,
God called you to do this. God anointed you to do this. We're going to become number one in the industry.
And he told me that. I was like, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. And then he shook my face and
grabbed my head and said, no, this is serious. You're the next Art Williams. We're the next movement.
We're going to go do something that's never been done before. We're going to become number one in
the industry. We're going to be a $30 billion company. We're going to take care of our people.
We're going to change the world. And I said, all right, let's go. Let's go. And I've been after it,
after it, after it. And so has our leadership team. And guess what? It's a hundred times better than I
even thought it was going to be, but guess what? We're just getting started and the best is yet to
come. We want you to be an EMB. We want you to be an agency owner. We want you to be a senior partner
of GFI. We know for a fact that everybody does better with a deadline, with our five Fs and our
fulfillment formula, with our inspirational marketing, with Teva technologies, with our builder's
compensation plan. And then the POP program. Are you kidding me? The partnership ownership program.
I'm going to finish with this. I'm going to end with this and I'm going to turn it back to Matt
Welsh. Can you imagine five years from now, it's 2030, the biggest wealth transfer happening in the
history of North America? Because we're not just a U.S. company. We're a Canada company. We're a Puerto
Rico company, GFI international. We are coast to coast. We are taking over the globe,
global financial impact. We're making a huge impact globally. 78 million baby boomers are retiring.
Biggest wealth transfer happening in North America. $84 trillion switching hands all in the next five
years. I talked to my business advisors and my business mentors. He said, Eric, how did you and
Sandra pick the perfect, perfect time to start GFI? I said, what do you mean? He said, every other
company has already sold. Every other company has already been bought out. Every other company's
already had their equity event. GFI is the only platform company in the entire financial industry
that is still independent, that hasn't had their equity event. And you guys have hundreds of leaders
who know what they're doing. He said, there's a trillion percent chance you'll be number one.
He said, how'd you pick the perfect time? I said, all I know is God favored individuals.
And if God is for you, who could be against you? That's all I can say. We are at the right place
at the right time with the right company, with the right products, with the right people,
with the right leaders, with the right technology, with the right platform. I want you to ask your
friends, if you know friends at other companies, say, how do you feel that you're with a company
that has no upside potential? There's other companies out there that have to partner with
other companies because they're broke. They have to partner with other leaders because
they're broke just to try to get capital. We have money. We're good. We are good. Right? Times 10.
Does that make sense? So here's the deal. You are at the right place at the right time. You saw the
vision. You're the smart ones. Good news. We are the only independent platform company out there
that has a huge upside potential. And oh, by the way, you'll still make three, four, five, six,
seven, 10 million a year along the way because we have the best builders comp plan in the industry.
We double the generational overrides in other companies. We double the bonuses in other companies.
We give a hundred percent advance up front. We have 14 platinum companies that pay platinum
compensation. We have no caps on our commissions. People are making $50,000, $200,000 per sale. The only
cap we have in GFI is Greg cap. Are you kidding me? Right? They not like us. They not like us. And
you need to know that. And you need to believe that. So on the 10th of the month, because it's the 10th,
if I were to give you one more thing, I said, everyone does better with a deadline. So you've
got to go all out for 80 days. Number one, number two is the, you've got to do more appointments than
you've ever done in your life, which is 30 appointments a week. And then number three, the last thing I would say
that worked for me, you know, I promoted and developed over 1500 EMDs in my career, 1500 EMDs,
1500 agency owners in the last 20 plus years, 104 direct, 104 direct, but 1500 EMDs. You know what
I told them every single time you got to do 10 and 10, three months in a row. You got to do 10 and 10,
three months in a row, 10 recruits on your team and 10 personal sales per month, 10 recruits on your
team per month, 10 personal apps per month, three months in a row. So 10 personal sales per month, and then
10 recruits on your team per month, three months in a row. So if you go all out for 80 days with that deadline,
you do more appointments you've ever done in your life, minimum 30 appointments a week, and you do 10 and 10,
three months in a row, 10 personal sales, and 10 recruits on your team every month for three months in a row.
By the way, it's not 10 recruits direct. You get three direct recruits, three direct business partners.
Those three get three. You got 12. You already got 12 on your team, which is 10. So because today's the
10th of the month, you got to do 10 and 10, three months in a row. Okay. Is that a deal? Who thinks
they can do that? Yes. All right. Last thing. So let's fast forward five years from now. By the way,
five years ago, it was fast. Five years today is fast. Five years from now is going to be fast.
Those of you that are in your forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies, you guys know time goes
by faster. The older you get when you, when you're in your twenties or early thirties, you think that
five years is like a hundred years from now, we're going to snap our fingers. It'll be five years.
We're going to snap our fingers. It'll be 2030. You understand that? I mean, that's the truth.
So Greg cap will be 80 years old in five years. Greg cap will be 80 years old in five years. And that's
the dream. I sold them where we're going all out until 2030. And then once you're 80, then you can, uh,
semi-retire, but then we'll renegotiate his contract after that. Is that a deal? Don't tell him, but
that's the truth. All right. So, but cause we want him here till he's a hundred because he's such a
great asset, but I want you to imagine five years from now, you become a senior partner. You're making
a seven figure income. You're running an eight figure business. You've developed 10, six figure
earners. You guys know that's been my business philosophy now for 23 years. If I help others get to
where they want to go, I'll get to where I want to go. That's how it works. It's a beautiful thing.
It really is a virtuous cycle where you help others get to where they want to go. You'll get to where
you want to go. How do you get to EMD? You promote an MD on your team. That's it. You promote a marketing
director on your team. You'll be an EMD. How do you become a seven figure earner? You help 10 people on
your team make six figures. You help 10 people on your team make six figures. You make seven figures.
How do you make eight figures? You help 10 people on your team make seven figures. You've made eight
figures. Boom. If you help others get to where they want to go, you'll get to where you want to go.
So you fast forward five years from now, you're making a seven figure income. You've developed 10,
six figure earners. You have an eight figure business per year. You're about to become a senior
partner of GFI, just like Matthew and Allie Welsh, just like Levi and Nisamboni, just like Mario and
Lisa Bayona, just like Yuriv and Margo Azoulay. By the way, you know, we have five more senior
partners coming out in the next three months. We're gonna have a hundred senior partners come out
of GFI. If they can do it, you can do it. You know, we have 412 EMDs right now in GFI, 412 EMDs
in GFI right now, 412 agency owners in GFI right now. What's my point? If they can do it,
you can do it. Makes sense. If they can do it, you can do it. If 412 different people have already
done it from all different states, all different places, all different shapes and sizes, all different
nationalities, all different religions, all different backgrounds, all different demographics
and geographics and genders and orientations and parts of the world, and they can do it, you can do it.
Simple as that. We believe all 720 of you can make it happen. But if it is to me, if it is to me,
it's up to me. Get your spouse involved. What if one of you recruits and one of you sells?
What if one of you does operations and one of you does the field and you come together as a power
couple? Oh, you will explode. No one will ever see it coming and you'll double and triple and beat
everybody. Is anybody competitive? Is anybody competitive? I hope so. All right. So let's say
you make a half a million this year, you become a 1% or if you're an EMD this year, you're an agency
owner this year. Every single one of you should be thinking half a million bucks. I want you thinking
March 31st, I'm an EMD. December 31st, I got my half a million dollar ring. That's what you should
be thinking. Seriously, you should be thinking that. EMD agency owner by March 31st, $500,000 ring by
December 31st, right? I believe you can do that. Okay. And if you think you can or you think you
can't, either way, you're right. So you're making a half a million this year and then a million the next
year and then 2 million the next year and then 3 million the next year, then 4 million the next
year, then 5 million the next year, because we're doubling up. You see my wristband? Double up,
right? Welcome to the good life. Double up. That's what we're doing. So every year you double up.
Half a million, million, two, three, four, five, boom. By the end of 2030, boom, we pop off. We have our
equity event. We go public. We pop off. Partnership ownership program. You're making 5 million a year in
personal income, which is your EBITDA times a 30 times multiple. You're going to get the same
multiple as GFI because you're a senior partner. You have your own company. You partner with GFI.
GFI is the platform. You're the senior partner. You're the CEO of your own company. We get the
same multiple. What's 5 million a year personal income, which you'll be making 5 years from now,
times 30. What's 5 times 30? What's 5 times 30? $150 million. $150 million. And then GFI puts in
about 10%. And then you put in about 10%. So then 20% of that goes to your junior partners,
goes to the inner circle, goes to the agency owners, goes to the mother-in-law. So everybody's
taken care of. So you got 150 million. What's 20%? That's 30 million. So now you had 120 million net.
Are you with me? $150 million check, 30 million, then goes to your people, goes to your EMDs,
goes to your leaders, goes to your little MDs and SMDs on your team, right? And so boom. So you've got
the 120 million. The other 30 million goes to your people. And then it's just a win, win, win, win.
So how awesome would that feel if you're getting $120 million check and 30 million goes to your people,
goes to your team, goes to your agency owners, goes to your organization, goes to your family,
goes to your mother-in-law. That's what we're talking about. This is real. These are all legal
documents. We've been thinking about this and talking about this for five years. And now it's
all reality. You understand? Matt Wells already signed his 200 page legal document. This is real.
Matt Wells is already making 5 million a year times 30, 150 million. Matt Wells is already worth $150
million at age 30. You know, the only difference between him and you is he believes a little bit
more because he's been to a couple more of these meetings. Now you got to believe. Now you got to
have the energy. Now you got to have the conviction. You've got what it takes. The only question is,
are you willing to do what it takes? So here's my question. When you get that $150 million check,
where are you buying your island? Where are you buying your island? You know, it's funny. I was talking
to a couple, a couple of weeks ago and they're like fighting right now. They're like, who's going
to do operations? Who's going to do the field? Who's going to recruit? Who's going to sell? Who's
going to watch the kids? And then the lady says, Hey, here's the deal. We're both going to have a
hundred million dollars in five years. You buy your own island. I'll buy my own island. We'll be next
door to each other. And then we'll go visit each other and visit the kids. I started laughing. I was like,
that's hilarious, right? It's like whatever it takes W I T I hope your faith and marriage get
better. So you don't have to worry about that. But you guys get what I'm saying. This is an
opportunity of a lifetime. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. Don't take it for granted. Take
advantage. How did you get so lucky and so blessed to be a part of this company right now? And all we
missed the last two years was the growing things. That's it. The last two years was like the
infrastructure, the operations, Teva technologies, the carriers, like all that stuff. And now
boom, I just met a guy yesterday. He's making $2 million a year. He's quitting everything and
starting with GFI. That happens every single day. I have another company. I won't mention their name.
We're announcing it in a couple of weeks. And they're like, can we bring in 10,000 people our
first month? Can we bring in 10,000 people our first month? I go, yeah, we're announcing that February
first. This is real. Like, I don't know if you're for real, but I know GFI is for real. And here's
the deal. We're looking for leaders. We're looking for leaders. You got to step up. Let's go. No more
excuses. Have your reasons. Your family is worth it. Your last name's about to be changed forever.
GFI is going to go change the world. We're doing good things for good people. You realize what we do?
We're protecting families. We're protecting health. We're protecting wealth. We're giving people an
opportunity to change their life. You should be excited about that. Stop being so casual.
Casual people become casualties in business. And you know what I know about you? You're a champion.
You got what it takes. God has your back. Let's do this together. I'm trying to not motivate you,
but inspire you. Inspirational marketing. We're in this together. We're God's chosen people. This is a
God chosen family. We got what it takes, but we got, we got to be willing to give whatever it takes.
Simple as that. So this is going to happen. We're looking for leaders. Leadership development is
our focus. Marty and I, and Matt and Mario and Levi and John and Greg were like, who are our next
leaders? Who are our next big leaders? Who are our next big leaders? And I'm looking at them right now
on Zoom. These are the next big leaders in GFI. I'm proud to be in business with all of you. It's an
honor to be in business with all of you. This is not hype. This is real. This is not a dream. This is
reality. This is not just a vision. This is going to happen, but we need you to meet us halfway. It's
time to make a big decision for you to go all in and give your best. And I promise you, you're going
to be glad that you did. Thank you so much for having me. I'm going to pass it back to our host
and our MC, my little brother from another mother, the great Matthew Wells, our field chairman. I'll pass
it to you, Matt. Thank you. Oh my goodness. Anyone else ready to run through a brick wall right now?
Or is it just me? I'm ready to run through a brick wall right now. Eric, thank you so much
for that absolutely incredible message. And I could not agree more. We truly are the greatest platform
that the industry has ever seen. And I want you guys to know that. I want you to have confidence
in that. One of the reasons I have so much confidence is because of that man right there.
Anybody else have confidence because of that man right there as the foundation of this company?
I have so much confidence because of that. We're going to do things that this industry
has never seen before. We're breaking every single record. Did you guys know that within
our first two years, we helped more families than any other company ever has within two
years of starting. We promoted more six, multiple six and seven figure earners than any other company
ever has in history. Within our first two years, we are literally shattering every single
record, every single record. And that's what you're a part of. And you are a part of that.
You are building that. And we just want you to know that we appreciate you. But now we got
to go to another level. We know that if you want to grow the company, grow the leadership
and the leadership grows the company. That's the point of this call. You are the next wave
of leadership in this company. The quality of your leadership matters. You matter. What you
do matters. Everything that you do, people are watching. You're the example. If you do
something wrong, you are duplicating wrong. But if you operate with integrity in everything
that you do, you are duplicating the standard of integrity. How you talk to people, how you
treat people, how you work, how you execute, the numbers you produce. All of those things
is setting the example to the next wave of people. You have to realize that people look up
to you. You're an MD and an SMD. There are a lot of people that look up to you because
they want your title. They want your promotion level. They want your contract level. And so
whatever they see you do, they're going to look at it and say, okay, is that how I get
there? So zero directs. That's how I become a marketing director. Do zero directs in the
month of January. Oh, don't produce anything. That's how I get to marketing director. That's
how I get to senior marketing director. See, your actions speak so loud. I can't hear
you. Your numbers speak so loud. I can't hear you. I want you to write this down. The best
type of leader is a do it first leader. The best type of leader is a do it first leader.
Be the example in everything that we do. Can we do that? Yes, yes, yes. Awesome. Awesome.
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. So I am super excited because I get to bring up our next speaker.
Do you guys want to hear from the number one promoted organic EMD in the last 12 months?
You guys want to hear from them? Anybody? Yes, yes, yes. Well, guess what? You get to,
you get to, you get to. Today we have Megan Armas that is logging on and let me just give you some
stats. Okay. Megan is an incredible mom. She's an incredible wife and she's running a family,
running a household. Her husband is awesome. He's awesome, but he's not building this business with
her. He just supports her and encourages her. And that's awesome. He has a full career. He loves
his career. He has a passion and he's doing that every single day. So she is a power couple,
but she's building this thing individually, making this thing happen with two little kids at home
under the age of four. And let me just give you some stats. Her first 12 months as an EMD,
ready? First 12 months as an EMD, million point base shop, million point base shop promoted a direct
EMD, promoted two ring earners and one quarter million dollar earner. She's about to promote
another EMD out of her base shop all within 12 months of being an EMD on this platform.
Just think about that for a second. Just think about that. She's the epitome of setting the
standard. Megan, we are so proud of you. Thank you for being such a great example. She's also the most
positive, loving, energetic person you'll ever meet. You can't be mad when you're around her
because all she'll do is make you smile and laugh. She also is my manager at Jamba Juice.
I have to mention that 14 years ago, I met her because she was my Jamba Juice manager.
And now we get to not just build smoothies together, but build a business, which is pretty
awesome. So Megan, love you. Appreciate you. So proud of you. Make some noise for the one and only
Megan, our Moss.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, records on my demo.
Hey, hey.
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the intercontinental.
Oh my gosh, you guys, how do I follow the president, the CEO, and just everybody here in GFI? What an honor it is to be here with everybody. I am so excited about this call specifically because I remember logging onto these calls and thinking to myself, how do I become? How do I do what they're doing? Because where I was at when I started, I didn't have this all figured out. And you guys, if I'm going to do anything with you, I've got to start my timer.
Because if anybody knows me, I will talk to you for the next 20, 30 minutes and I can't. I've got a time slot today to respect every speaker because everybody is so incredible. But I knew that if I was going to come into this industry, I needed to lead myself. I needed to do what I was good at. I needed to bring forward what I could do to make the environment better, to help other people, and to lead from where I was with what I had. And that looked so different.
And so if I can do anything over the next few minutes, you guys, I want to leverage with you. I want to meet you right where you're at because I don't just want to, you know, excite you and impress you because that is so real. Like every single speaker that I'm hearing is speaking to my soul and I'm sitting here and I'm taking notes and I'm listening because this is your opportunity and it's mine.
And I'm not here to convince you that it's legitimate because you can see that it is. You see the people winning, but you have to decide that you also deserve to win. That's it. That is plain and simple.
And some things that I wrote down, and I hope it matters to you guys, is that the people that are winning bigger and faster just believe a little bit more. That's all that it is.
They are not looking for a sign. They are making themselves the sign. And that's what I did. I said, if this is the opportunity and everybody else can win, for me, you guys, everything is proof that I can win.
Nothing is too good for me. God created all of us equally. And so if there is a system to follow, I know Tony Luisi just picked that one up.
I love the nonverbal energies here, you guys. Like if God created us, I know my God wants me to win. I know that there's a system to follow. I know that we have leadership that has our back.
I know that if other people can do it, we can do it. You have to decide that you deserve to win. You guys, typically I like to shoot from the hip.
I think I do my best when I'm just in a flow, but there's so many important things that I remember needing to know as a marketing director,
needing to know as somebody that was going to go out and run a team and just be a strength in this organization.
And I look back over the last 12 months and I'm going to be very honest.
2025 felt like a free fall because so much of learning is by doing.
And so many people in this environment want to learn because they've mastered it and then they don't ever rule anything.
And that's a mistake. You've got to take action from where you're at. You've got to lead from where you are.
I always took ownership from the level that I had to give. I always looked at how can I make this team stronger?
Because when I came in, I was pregnant with my son and I've had two babies during building this.
I've given myself the opportunity to take time off, build this thing, have babies, build my family, support.
You know, my husband supports us, but I wanted to get good here, you guys.
And do you know why that is?
It's because I knew that my family deserves somebody who went all in and figured it out instead of just made excuses.
My family deserves that.
I want my husband to look at his wife and say, yeah, I have her back, but she's got mine.
And I know what getting, oh, I'm going to cry.
I'm going to get emotional. I'm going to get hot.
You guys are trying to wear a different colored shirt because, you know, I get like a lobster.
So I wrote this down. Confucius said, why did I quote Confucius?
He who conquers himself is the mightiest warrior.
He who conquers himself.
There is nobody against you in this industry.
And if they are, forget them.
They are not part of your story except to make you stronger.
So don't let them take you down.
Oh, speaking from the heart right now.
One of the differences between being someone successful and unsuccessful people is that there's a group full of doers while others are full of wishers.
Which one are you going to be, you guys?
Because like I said, I'd rather have a life where I saw me do what was possible than watching everybody else show me what was possible for them.
This is just the vehicle.
This is not hard.
This is simple.
Stop trying to make this harder than what it is.
There's a system to follow.
You don't have to have all of this figured out.
You don't have to be figuring out how to run retreats.
Right now you are in another base.
You are in your EMD's base.
Take advantage of where you're at right now.
You need to get as many people as possible into that environment.
You need to get good at leading a team while working with your EMD so that you can go out and be successful on your own.
You guys, I've put down bullet points.
Like I said, normally I like to shoot from the hip, but there's so many important things I didn't want to miss.
And so if this is speaking to you, I see the chats blowing up, lighting up.
I just want you, my lucky number is nine.
Put a nine in the chat.
If already you're like, I get it.
This is for me.
I don't have to be, I don't have to sound like Matt or Marty, or which by the way, I've got to do karaoke with Marty because his walkout song, I don't think anybody knows that I can.
I can rap, but I can rap that song.
It's not just Matt.
It's mine.
So Marty, karaoke is happening.
Like, why are we playing with it?
Why are we playing small?
You guys know that I never had my family's support in doing this.
I didn't ask for it because I never had it before this business.
So I wasn't going to win because of them.
I was going to win because I have a husband that loves me.
I've got a burning desire.
And I know that God created me to help other people, plain and simple.
So this is the only type of vehicle, you guys, where, where else can I cuddle my babies and still make a million dollars a year making sure that I just went and taught somebody else how to eat for the rest of their life.
This is not just about you and me.
This is about getting good so that you can teach somebody else, if I can fish, I can eat forever.
But I am not just here to eat.
I am here to teach you how to feed yourself.
So we got to play.
We got to win.
We got to start doing what we can do from where we're at.
Number one, I have five bullet points for you guys.
So why am I winning as a new EMD?
Let's go.
I am not made from anything different than anybody else.
I am figuring this out as I'm doing it, you guys.
That is number one.
Like so many of us are in a base and like, I got to do this.
You need to follow the system.
It is so simple.
You guys, if it was harder, it would be worth it.
But if it was harder, my gosh, like let's keep it simple for what it is.
So why am I winning?
Why is this working?
Why are we able to do all of this?
Number one, I am extremely coachable.
I implement the play.
My EMD was Matthew Welsh.
He didn't treat me different just because we worked together at Jamba Juice 14 years ago.
He was 16.
I was 20.
We weren't best friends.
He just followed up with me because he knew that I loved people.
I'm not a financial guru, nor will I ever be.
That's not my calling.
My calling is to help people.
So get as many people here as possible.
And when that wasn't my focus at first, I said, okay, well, if I'm going to be part of
someone else's team, how can I make it stronger?
How can I make it stronger?
Whatever my coach says to do, I'm here to play that.
I am not here to pretend like I know a system better that was created before I was here.
There's no recreating the wheel while I'm still learning to drive.
So implement what works.
You've got to copy the right cat.
Megan, who do I copy?
The winning EMDs.
Look at their sauce.
What are they doing?
They've got hot environments.
They are bringing people together.
They are leading themselves by example.
They are constantly doing personal development.
That's one of my biggest focuses this year, you guys.
And I, again, I've got a year of EMD in front of you.
So I'm looking at really, really what worked because I need 2026 to double, if not triple,
2025.
And so if you're thinking like that, I love what Eric said, which was, what did we do over
the last 80 days that was groundbreaking?
And if it wasn't anything, then why will the next 80 days be groundbreaking?
You have to decide that something is going to change.
You have to immediately take massive action.
You cannot negotiate with what it takes to win.
You've got to stop negotiating because otherwise you're going to become 50, 60, 70 and trying to
cling on to who you could have been.
Right now is who you are.
Stop making excuses.
Number two, get in the room.
Get in the room.
You've got to mobilize to calls and get in smaller rooms every single time.
You've got to show up if your leader invites you.
You need to qualify for everything, whether it's what GFI puts on, like all of us doing
Growth Academy, you guys, put a two in the chat if you already got your Growth Academy
a ticket.
I hope that you did.
Right now we're packing for Puerto Vallarta because of what we did from the last Growth
Academy.
We've got some of our team going.
It's absolutely incredible.
You want to qualify for everything that the company puts on.
Otherwise, you feel like you're not winning because you're not doing what everybody else
is doing because you avoided the work that it took to get there.
So you need to qualify anything that the company puts on, anything that your EMD puts on.
If it's a retreat, if it's mobilizing to one of the city tours, whatever it is, get there.
And most importantly, never miss a team call.
Megan, you're talking about how to be an EMD.
Why are you talking about the team calls?
Because why would you ever miss something that somebody put on to help make you better?
That is getting in the room.
Get in the room with what you're leaving.
wants you to hear. Get in the room with the speakers that are there to make you better,
you guys. Mobilize and get other people there. Qualifying to be in places, you guys, means it's
not just about yourself. This entire company, this entire opportunity is not just about you.
It's about how can you help the next person do it. So if I'm going to be a leader, I'm going to
make sure that other people are also qualifying to be in those rooms. I'm going to make sure that
other people are qualifying to be part of Frontline or part of the retreats going on or some of the
qualifying events going on. I'm getting other people there because their life can change. And
now if you and me are thinking the same, we're working the same, we're doing this, we're putting
points and recruits on the board, we're both winning, but I didn't have to convince you.
That brings me to my third point and in my opinion, the most important one.
And that's CFTs. Why am I winning as a new EMD? If I'm an MD on this call, an MD or an SMD on this
call, I want you to take some pressure off of yourself by thinking you've got to do it all.
But I need you to then move that pressure into understanding how you need to be working with
other people. CFTs independent of me writing business is why we exploded so fast. I didn't
go out and I wasn't the only strength in the room. This is about building a team of other people that
are independent and writing business. You have got to get them doing it themselves to identify who your
real partners are. Put a three in the chat if that hit you. If you're an MD in the base and you're like,
I'm mobilizing, I'm carrying it, I'm constantly putting all of the energy forward. You've got to
move that so that other people are doing it themselves. Help them do it themselves. There's
leaders in my team wanting to win for themselves. I've never had to convince people to win. I just
had to show them how. And then everybody is helping each other win, you guys. I promise, and I'm not
trying to be silly, it's not rocket science. It's truly, if I want to win, do you want to win?
You want to win? Then you need to be independent so that I can see how you work. I can see what you
do. And I wasn't even an MD at that time, but I understood transferring knowledge and skill.
You're seeing a fire right now within our base. We are creating history as the first EMD base to hit
a million points in their first year. But this is a big fire built by a lot of people. There are many
hands. It is not just me, but I'm aware that I am here first. So compared to others, I go the way.
I create opportunity for proximity for my people. We are so, so supported. The minute I became EMD,
ask any other EMD that's doing incredibly well or any EMD that's got skin in the game. I call them,
and I have never had a call that has not been returned. Everybody has everybody's back. I am
also willing to help anybody else win. I will train. I will speak. I will go to your retreats,
just like they are for me and just like you guys should be doing for other people.
Number four, I'm almost done here. Track everything to face your truth in business.
Track everything. Notice how Eric knew all of the numbers of this company. He knew all of the
chargebacks from somebody. He knew every business partner of somebody else. That's not by accident.
That is so intentional. You aren't tracking because one, you don't have the volume or two,
you don't want to face your truth. Tracking also looks like tracking your zeros and looking yourself
in the mirror and saying, I'm really not putting anything into my business. And it is owning where
you're at. You need to track it to face your truth. I want everybody to write this down.
Everything from associate to marketing director is emotional. Everything from associate to marketing
director is emotional. That is where most people quit. That is where most people give up. That is
where most people think this is harder than I wanted it to be. This is different than I thought it would
be because I'm half in, half out. And what do you know? So are my results. It is emotional because
from associate to field associate and sometimes to senior associate, you have a trainer that will
do the work with you and for you half the time. That's why I need people to be a CFT as soon as
possible because I need to know who are my players, who are my partners. I am not your boss. I am here
to run with you. I got you in the room. Don't ever hold it against me that I didn't hold your hand to
the finish line. That's your finish line. From everything from associate to MD is emotional. Everything
from MD to EMD is duplication. Write it down again. Everything from MD to EMD is duplication. So find
who's good without you and train them to be independent and run. Theodore Roosevelt said,
do what you can with what you have and where you are, you guys. So what can you control? I want you
guys to all be more active in the chats. If I'm an MD and I'm planning on running my own base,
how do you run the sales team that you're in right now? It is not on your EMD to do everything.
You are in that base to run it, to help your EMD, to make their load lighter, to train the team.
You want to be more active in chats. You want to be more active in your personal work.
You have to stop avoiding everything. You've got to be more honest about your results and your work
ethic. Ooh, my time is almost up here. You've got to be more attuned to your desires. Do you want to
win? Do you want to win? Then decide to qualify for smaller circles. You've got to keep it simple,
you guys. I promise you it's not hard. I promise if I can do this, single in business, two babies,
we are going for a third baby here and probably a fourth. I mean, seriously, you guys, I'm looking
to thrive in my marriage. I'm joining a serving team in church because in this business, we support
your life getting better. You being more of a fulfilled human being. And of course your finances
increase. That's what makes EMD so fun because it's not just about you. It's about helping everybody else
win. I promise you it's not hard. It is a system. I am doing this because I decided to. It is simple.
So number five, my last one, and then I'm going to wrap it up. You must decide that you will win.
When is that? And be relentless in what it takes to make that happen. Your time is limited. Do not
waste it living someone else's life because again, everything is proof to me that I can win. And in 2025,
you guys, we did good, but we're going from good to great because we didn't come into this business
to not just change lives. We are here to do the best that we can to impact as many people as we can.
And 2025 was a bit of a free fall, but we still landed in the top twenties and the top tens. And I am so,
so proud of our team, but we will be the first base shop to hit a million points in the first year
of being an independent team. We figured this out by becoming, but I want you to write down that
fortune favors the bold fortune favors the bold. Now we've got some footing under us. So truly it
is game on and we are looking for who is here to win. So on that, I'm going to pass it back
to our incredible field chairman, Matthew Welsh. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Anyone feeling
inspired right now? How many of us on this call right now want to try to make the commitment
to beat Megan's record within our first 12 months of being an EMD? Anybody? So across $400,000 in
income, literally this month, their team did a million points, promoted two ring earners, a quarter
million dollar earner, promoted an EMD, about to promote another one. I want to challenge all of
you guys to go out strong, go out strong. There's a, there's a, the way our base shop communicates is
you leave your base shop better than you found it. And I want you to write that down. I need to leave my
base shop better than I found it. So if I went into my base shop and they're doing a million points,
I got to leave my base shop at 2 million points. If I went into my base shop and they're at 600,000,
I got to leave my base shop at 1.2 million. If I went into my base shop and the environment was stale,
then I'm the person that made the environment positive and uplifting and encouraging. It's so
funny to me how many people come to me and they say, Hey Matt, my, my, the, the, the energy of my
base shop is not there. Well then bring some energy. That's all your EMD is looking for. The
EMD can't carry the weight all on their own. They need people to step up and say, I'm going to
contribute to this environment. I'm going to contribute to this culture. I'm going to contribute
to the energy. It is that this is what most people do. They show up to the fire to get warm,
but never bring wood. Most people show up to the fire to get warm, but never bring wood. That's how
most people act in a base shop. If you looked at your base shop over the last 12 months,
how many times did you show up to the fire and not bring wood?
Your EMD can't carry the weight of everything on their own. They need you to step up and say,
you know what? I'm going to be involved in the chats. I'm going to be positive. I'm going to be,
I'm going to be the first one on the zoom every single week. When my base shop call starts,
I'm not logging in two to three minutes after the time, because I know they're playing a video.
I'm logging in 15 minutes early so I can be adding to the environment, adding to the
culture, adding to the chat. I'm going to be the first person that posts in all the chats every
single morning. I'm going to post all the results. I'm going to send motivational videos and quotes.
I'm going to reach out to my sidelines and my teammates when I don't see them on a call or when
I haven't heard from them in a moment, I'm going to reach out to them just to check on them. I'm
going to leave my base shop better than I freaking found it. That needs to be your mentality.
That needs to be your mentality. I'm going to leave the base shop better than I found it.
Culturally, production wise, recruiting wise, energy wise, unification, be the person in your
base shop that you would want to be have. When you go out to EMD, do you want to just carry the
weight of the world on your shoulders or do you want to have people that you can count on?
So then be the person to your EMD base shop that you would want to have in your base shop because you
attract who you are, not who you want. And what's going to happen is you're going to go out to EMD
and you're going to be like, man, I want all these people. I want people to show up early.
Well, did you while you were in the base shop? I want people to add to the chat. Well, did you
while you were in the base shop? I want people to do this, that, or the third. Well, did you while you
were in the base shop? You attract who you are, not who you want. Be the person, be the leader,
step up and be a contributor to your environment. Make the environment hot for everyone else that comes
into it. Some people are like, I'll plug into the environment once I have a team.
There's not going to be a team if you don't give them an environment that they want to plug into.
Can we make that commitment? Yes, yes. Awesome. Great message, Megan. So, hey, I'm excited. I get
to bring up, do you guys want to hear from the number one base shop in the entire company?
Goodness gracious. We got Leland Rubin on this call right now. And he runs the number one base
shop in the entire company, about to cross a three million point base shop, a top personal producer
in the company, a top recruiter in the entire company, leading our entire faith division.
If there's someone that's always willing to step up and contribute to GFI and say, hey, I got it.
I got it. That's me. Throw me in, coach. Whatever the company needs, I'm willing to do it. It's this
gentleman right here. What I love about this man is not only is he a person of integrity, not only is he a
great husband and dad, not only is he a pastor, not only is a man of faith, not only is he an
incredible human being, but he is hungry. He's a student. They say that the difference between the
master and the student is that the master learned to never stop being a student. And this man seeks
out mentorship more than anyone I've ever seen in my entire life. I was in the Ethos headquarters the
other day for 14 minutes and he walks up and said, hey, Matt, can I ask you a couple of questions?
He's running the number one base shop in the company. What questions does he has for me?
You guys with me on this? He's a hungry man. And that's why him and Wajma and their incredible
organization and team is crushing it. So Leland, I just want you to know, I love you, brother. So
blessed to be in business with you. Please give it up for the number one base shop in the company,
$1.5 million earner, the one and only Leland Rubin.
All right. All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning to everybody. I'm so excited to be here.
Matthew, thank you so much for that great introduction. I just want to say thank you to
you for being one of the greatest field chairmen of all time, always willing to help us with anything
we got. And I'm so excited. How many of you guys heard all these great speakers today that are
actually coming up here, pouring out to get you to go where you want to go? I want you to write this
down. I start off all my talks like this all the time. You're closer than you think. You're closer
than you think. You're so much closer than you think. And my job here today is to actually let you
understand that how you can have a true personal example and give you some points of how you can
actually get to your executive marketing director. You know, it's so important for you to understand
that you are called to do this business. Write that down. You are called to do this business. How do I
know that you're called to do this business? Because the man upstairs picked you at this appointed time,
at your appointed life, to be able to have some, do something special. And you actually have the
opportunity to be under the greatest leadership, to be on the greatest platform that's ever been
assembled, to have the greatest technology. And you're here with us today, really understanding
that you could take it to the next level. I want to unplug some of those blocks. I want to get you to
come over some of those obstacles. But most of all, I want you to understand that nothing can stop you
in this business. Nothing. You have to make a decision to go all in. So let's kind of talk about this.
I want to bring up a few points. But the first point I want to bring up is there's a book that
I love to read, but I want to break it down to you a little bit differently today. I want to break it
down kind of how we break it down at church sometimes. The book is called Think and Grow Rich.
Write this down. Think and Grow Rich. So pastor, what is it that I got to do to really get EMD? Well,
number one, you got to change your thinking. As a man, think if so shall he be. You have to get your
thoughts together and see yourself as an EMD already before you get there. You got to walk like it.
You got to talk like it. You got to act like it. You got to get with your coaches and say,
what do I got to do? What do I have to do? How do I get myself in shape to be able to do this?
You got to start changing your thinking. You see, there's so many people that have desire,
but never get to results. I want to move you from desire to results in 2026. It's okay to have great
desires. It's okay to think about things that you want to have, but the work that's involved is
right in the middle. That's going to be able to get your results. So the first thing you got to do is
change your, what you're thinking. Number two, you got to develop a, what a growth mentality.
You got to have a growth mentality. Just like Matthew was saying earlier, there's no possible
way for your personal example to be so small. And then you thinking that you're going to grow.
A lot of people come to me and they say, pastor, can you pray for me? I'm like, I can pray for you,
but let's pray together that you start getting a growth mentality, that you understand that every
single opportunity, every single day, you have an opportunity to put your name on an ICA.
You have an opportunity to change somebody's life, to protect the family. You have an opportunity to
bring somebody in. You see, I believe that anybody who joins my organization, I can change their life.
You got to get that belief. We are here to change people's life. We're here to make people's
marriages better, people to have better homes, people to have spiritually better.
I get the privilege and the honor to run the faith division. And one thing I've learned about running
the faith division is a lot of people talk about faith, but they don't grow in faith. Write this
down. You have to grow in your faith. You have to understand that the man upstairs is ready to take
care of you and take you to higher heights. So I need you to grow, change your thinking and then what?
Get a growth mentality. Don't let recruiting stop you. Don't let production stop you. Don't let
licensing stop you. Don't let promotion stop you. Don't let your family stop you. Don't let
people stop you. Don't have approval diction. Just get going and understand that you can actually be
able to grow. Then the third one is that you got to understand that will lead you to become rich.
Well, what does it mean just to be rich? We practiced 5S, faith, family, fun, fitness, and finance.
That makes you rich. The fact that you have all 5S and that you can work on them, you'll have a better
life. So you got to understand that rich in our organization is not just money. Yes, the money is
great, but we designed a platform that will make you rich in all areas. Since I've been with Eric
Olson and Mario Biona for the last 10 years of my life, my life has been enriched. I mean, it's so rich
that I can pour out blessings to other people all the time. Do you know that there are millions of
people right now that are waiting for you to change your thinking, get ready to grow, and then now you
can get them rich based on the fact that you could bring in the GFI. So you got to understand that some
people are out there. They're doing a 40-40-40, right? They're working 40 hours a week. They're
working 40 years and still paying 40% taxes, and they don't really understand where they're at.
They're lost. It was just like me. I did every single thing that I could do. I tried every single
thing I could. I couldn't make it in basketball. I tried to do that and play overseas as a pro.
I couldn't make it in corporate America. I tried to become a vice president and did that.
But then one day, my life got what? Enriched. And it was basically because someone took the time
to teach me that I could believe in myself. You see, if you have belief in God, then that means
you ought to have big belief in yourself. Write this down. Learn how to believe in yourself. Because
some of us say that we're believers in God, but then we forget to believe in ourselves. Sad story
if somebody actually believes in God and doesn't believe in themselves. So I want to make sure you
understand with my 15 minutes here today, let me touch on a few points. You want to get to EMD,
number one, make sure you get your entire team promoted to the next level, okay? Get your team
on a run. You see, some of the people that are on your team that while you're in the base shop,
they're still a little associate. They're still a little senior associate. They need to be moved up.
So if they move on to their next promotion, that's automatically going to give you the things that
you need to be able to do. They're automatically going to be able to move your team points up.
That's automatically going to give you the fuel that you need to be in and out and hit it because
you got your personal example and then you got your team example. Number two, you got to make sure
that you get rid of approval addiction. Write this down. Approval addiction. Let me touch on this.
Steve Siebel book talks about what? Approval addiction. So I took a page out of this today
because I wanted to bless you a little bit. And on page 12, it talks about this. You don't need
anyone's blessing to be successful. You don't need anyone else's blessing to be successful.
You need to learn how to bless yourself. You need to learn how to touch yourself. You need to learn
how to sprinkle yourself. You don't need anyone else's blessing to be successful. Stop walking
around with your head down. Stop walking around with all those different things that are holding you
back. Number two, you don't need anybody else's approval. This is your chance. This is your last chance.
I got a burning desire. It's like Matthew was saying, I'm so hungry right now because why? I'm
going to become a key partner. Why? Because I want to change my last name forever. I have a saying
every day that I wake up that I'm a witness of God who lives by the five Fs. Faith, family, fun,
fitness, and finance. I'm the head of my family who's changing our last name forever. You know why?
I don't need anybody's what? Approval. Then number three, you don't need anybody's what? Permission.
You don't need anyone's permission to be successful in this business. You actually have the best things
in place that you can actually put into practice. So becoming an EMD, you got to get rid of approval
addiction, right? You got to get tired of done waiting. You got to have a burning desire that
allows you. I was talking to Eric Olson not too long ago, and he was telling me about how great Matt was
doing, and Matt's my brother, right? And then he was telling me how great Mario was doing, and Mario
was my brother. And then he was telling me how great Levi was doing, and Levi's my brother. And I started
banging my hand on a chair going, hey, what about me? I want to basically have my time too. Don't forget
about me. I want to go to the top of the company too. I want to get to the top of the company too. I'm
going to walk in my authority too. And I'm pumped up this morning because there's so many of you
on here that God told me to tell you, you got to walk in your authority. You got to walk in
your greatness. You got to start walking in what you got to do for your family. You got to start
walking in that. Stop being afraid. Don't be able to do that. So let me ask you a question.
Let me ask you a question. Here's something that I question a lot of people on, Megan.
I say, you got a big God. How do you have a small team? You can't have a big God and have a small team.
You got to understand that if you're a child of the King, that means that you are due an inheritance.
Write this down, guys. You're supposed to go take your inheritance. A lot of people,
I read this Bible all the time and it talks about me being a child of the King. Well, if I'm a child
of a King, that means automatically I have inheritance to go out there and blow up my
base shop. I have an inheritance to go out there and be able to blow up my production. I have an
inheritance to get my promotion by March and be able to walk out there and show my family that all
the nights that I've stayed up, all the time that I've taken away from my family, all the time that I
wasn't able to make certain things. Now I'm able to do this. So you got to realize I want to show
this quick thing real fast because I want to make sure that everybody catches onto this. So I'm going
to share my screen really fast here and I'm going to bring up one thing. The one thing that I want
to bring up here today, see if I can bring it up. It's here. Give me one second. See if I had it there.
Yeah, there we go. I want to make sure that everybody doesn't walk out of here and forget
this. Okay. All right, great. Got it. All right. So let's look at this. Everybody's been talking
about this today, about you getting an EMD. Everybody's been talking about the fact you become
the next executive marketing director. And this is our older poster because we changed a couple of
things. But I want to talk about this last part before my time is up. This executive marketing
director, you need 10 net license agents, right? Write that down. You need 10 net license agents.
Okay. Because I want to make sure that you do this. As we're talking about the walking in our authority,
let's make sure that we go get our 10 net license agents. Okay. Number two, the 150,000 points now is
100,000 points. So we gave you a discount. You used to have to do this in 12 months or six months.
Now you can actually do a what? In three months. So that means that basically now you actually have
three months and all you have to do is get 100,000 points. 50 with you, 50 with your team, 100,000 points.
Okay. Number three, you need to promote a marketing director. You need to have a good exchange leg.
Matthew just said it earlier. You got to leave the base shop better than what it was while you were in
there. So you want to get a good exchange and you want to learn how to give out a good exchange leg.
All right. You want to make sure that that exchange leg can do the same things that you do.
They're the same things. They know how to close. They know how to do illustrations. They know how
to do applications. They know how to bring people to the meetings. They know how to basically run a
business. So you want to give a good exchange leg. Write that down. A great exchange leg, right?
Then the fourth one is what? You want to get your $100,000 ring. You want to be able to get your ring,
right? You want to run and show that you can make some money in this business. So guys,
what am I really saying here today? We are the only organization that basically gives you the
example, gives you the results of what you got to do, and then see if you got the guts to be able to
do it. You see, I understood this a long time ago when I started in this business is that number one,
they're actually giving us a pathway to success. But then number two, GFI right now has done even
more than that. We are the only ones that have all the tools in place for you to become successful.
We're the only ones that have the technology to be able to do it, that basically have all the
couriers to be able to do it, have all the leadership to be able to do it. So we're inviting
you to become part of something great. My whole life, I've wanted to be part of something great.
My whole life, I've wanted to prove everybody wrong. My whole life, I've wanted to say, hey,
God, if you really love me, show me what you have for me. And I believe in my heart right now
that God has called us to be able to do this work. God has shown us the path to be able to do this.
And I'm not trying to motivate you. I'm trying to tell you that you need to understand and walk
in your authority and let your light shine so that other people can see your works. Let your light
shine so that other people can say, hey, I want to be a part of that. Let your light shine so your
family can understand that you're going somewhere. I have the opportunity to be here today with my kids.
My daughters are here today with me. And every single time I look at them, I'm so grateful that
I'm part of GFI. I'm so grateful that their futures are actually going to be bright. I'm so grateful
that my business, if I leave, when I leave this earth will be in good hands. I'm so grateful that
all the things and all the work that I did will not go in vain. So as I leave you here today, guys,
as I close here today, I want to give, I want to challenge you. Why not you? Why not now?
And how fast can you get there? Why not you? Why not now? And how fast can you get there?
You don't need to walk around with weights on your shoulders because we're already lifting you up.
You don't need to walk around with doubt because we're already showing you that it could be done.
You don't need to walk around and feel like you're not a part of something because you are part of the
greatest movement ever done in financial services. So I want you to feel like that. You're part of a
royal family. You're part of the things that are never, that they're going to write books about.
You're part of the situation of a faithful group of believers that are willing to walk around and
show the world that even though all those things that are going on outside, we're exploding. Even
though things are kind of fuzzy right now in our country, we're going to be the light. Even though
things right now have a lot of uncertainty, we're going to be the people that actually changed the
world, family by family. Why? Because we're God favored individuals. Don't ever forget that. You
are a God favored individual. With that, Matthew, I'm going to pass it back to you. Thank you so much
for having me on here. Goodness, goodness, goodness, goodness gracious. Leland blew it out of the water,
blew it out of the water. Guys, where there's a lack of clarity, we tend to slow down. And that's why I
appreciate Leland going over the requirements for EMD. And the fact that we have a special discount
going on right now, where we took the production, that's normally a six month production requirement
of 150,000. And we did 100,000 in three months. That's a huge deal. That's a huge deal, which is
why we got to go on a sprint. But I love the fact that Leland gave clarity on it. Well, why is that?
I love it because whenever there's confusion, people slow down. I want you to write this down. I need to
remove thinking. I need to remove thinking. If my people are not clear, they stop to think.
If my people do not understand, they stop to think. If you don't equip your people with what
they need to accomplish a goal or a task, they stop and think. Whenever someone has to stop and
think, it slows them down. When they slow down, guess what they're not focused on? Executing.
If it was pouring rain and foggy, and I go out and I start driving, do I normally drive faster or
slower in an environment like that? You drive slower. Why? Because things aren't clear. It's foggy.
It's rainy. It's not clear. So naturally, I'm going to slow down to keep myself safe. Yes or yes.
But when it's sunny like it is in San Diego right now, and it's clear skies, do I tend to speed up an
environment like this? Absolutely. Why? Because I can see clearly in front of me. I can see clearly now.
Right? I can see clear in front of me. Correct? So what is my point? The more clear you are on your
goals, the more clear you are on what's required to hit EMD, the more clear your people are on what
they need to do to hit senior associate this month, the faster they will execute, the less friction they
will experience, and the last doubt they will work with. Make sure you are clear. Make sure your people
are clear the same way Leland gave you that recipe just now. Leland, unbelievable, brother. We appreciate
you. So hey, I have the opportunity to hear from the newest senior partner in all of GFI. Do you guys
want to hear from the newest senior partner in all of GFI? Anybody? Anybody? Anybody? Let me give you
guys some of this man's stats. Okay? Let me give you some stats on this guy. Has an 11 million point
business. Business has 11 million. Super base did 5.5 million points last year. He recruited 3,000 people
last year. Anybody want to recruit 3,000? He recruited over 3,000 people last year. Base shop 1.2 million.
13 direct EMD ring earners. This guy is on fire. And so he literally crushes it in the base shop,
crushes it in the super base, crushes it in the super team. There's a lot of people that it might be good
in one area, but they're not great in another area. This guy is dominant.



in every single area, which is very impressive. It's a very impressive thing to run a killer
base shop, a killer super base and a killer super team. And that's exactly what he's doing. And it's
no wonder him and his amazing wife, Margo, just became the newest senior partners in GFI. He's a
great dad. He's a great husband. He just had a baby girl. His third child just had a baby girl
the other day. But more importantly than anything, he's just a man that cares. He's a loyal friend.
He's the person that will, you call at 2 a.m. in the morning and he'll be the first person to pick
up the phone and drive to go help you and be there for you. He's just a good human being, a good friend.
And the fact that I get to call him a brother means more to me than anything in this world. So Yurif,
I love you, brother. So proud of what you guys are building in your organization. Everybody do me a
favor, make some noise for the newest senior partner in GFI, the guy that broke the four
minute mile, the one and only Mr. Yurif Azule.
We can't, we can't hear your brother. I don't know what happened.
You hear me now?
Yeah, there you go.
There you go. Sorry about that. First of all, I want to say thank you to Matt, Eric, Mario, Levi,
Cap. I mean, everybody that is Marty that has set the pace, that has set the platform,
that has made it possible for us to get here. Especially Matt, I just want to say thank you.
The story is deep and most people don't know and might not ever know.
So we're excited. We just had a baby girl two and a half weeks ago. I want to say congratulations
to, you know, I was talking to, I was talking to Jordan Corio a couple hours ago and we're texting
and we're, you know, they're doing their, their gender reveal today. And they go, you know, he said,
he goes, do you know what it is? I said, I don't know. I just work here. Right.
And he goes, he goes, you know how to recruit and drive a boat. That's all you need to know.
And I said, I only recruit so I could have a boat to drive. Right. So we're going to talk a little
bit about recruiting. Right. And, you know, the very first person that I checked who was on was my
wife. You know, I'm like, you know, you check who's on. Right. And I just wanted to say like,
none of this would be possible without my wife. We have a two week old at the house. We have a three
year old at the house. We have a 13 year old at the house. We've got a dog. We've got a cat.
We've got everything going on. Right. And my nephew lives with us. Right. So like we've got a full house
and this, this woman just puts it together, keeps it together, keeps it going. And nothing makes me
want to drive and work harder than having my wife on this call, having her support me through my career
with this company. So I just want to let you guys know that's my secret weapon. So if you don't have
your wife or your husband or your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your partner, whatever you guys
title each other as, you can get them to support you. If you win, you can buy support. Right.
I could tell you that it's a lot easier to be excited for somebody that you're, you know,
that you're with if they're working hard, they're making it happen. So I just want to say thank you
to my wife. I think that's the most important thing first. All right. Don't look at the clock.
All right. We're not worried about this wasting your Saturday because I could tell you right now,
I made most of my monies on Saturdays and Sundays. Right. So this is about you guys understanding that
you've got to sacrifice a little bit, right? You've got to sacrifice some of your days
and some of your times. Second of all, sit on the edge of your seat, turn on your camera,
get excited, take notes, like whatever we say here today, try to make sure that you take something
away and actually apply it at your very next appointment. Like everybody here said something
that I wrote down that I'm going to use in my next appointment. Right. Like Eric literally gave
you every tool you could have in his conversation to go recruit individuals and agencies. Right. Like
think about some of the tools that you guys have gotten. So anyways, let's get rolling. Write down these
words, six words, character, leadership, confidence, decisiveness, no hesitation and clarity.
And I want you guys to understand that you're the next leaders in this company.
You're going to be doing this next year for somebody else. You're the next partners.
All it's going to take is for you to make a decision and be clear. That's it. That's really
all like, like we could, we could talk about all the little things that you have to do in that process,
but all you got to do is really make a decision. So I'm going to pull up my PowerPoint. We're going
to get rolling here and just make sure you guys are on the edge of your seat. Camera's on,
ready to roll. All right. So check this out. This might be that one slide that you see in your
career that goes, Oh man, that hit home. I could do this business. If I just understood this one
thing. So volume, the simple reason why some become an EMD fast, why some might never become an EMD,
why some become an EMD and have slow growth, or why some seem to always grow, make more money,
get more, get promoted and promote others. You know, later, like early on in my career,
you know, I, I kind of labeled myself and I don't want anybody to label themselves, but I labeled myself
as I, I'm just not a really great closer. I'm not really great at products or, um, I'm not,
you know, the guy that, you know, just to go out and talk to anybody. So I said, you know what,
I'm going to, I'm going to, I know where I can compete. And I said, I'm going to become a recruiter
because I can compete with anybody in recruiting. So I want you guys to understand, I don't care who
you are, what you label yourself as in this business. Um, but every single one of you
can compete in recruiting. It's a level playing field. It's the amount of people you talk to,
to the amount of appointments you have to the amount of people that buy or pay the one 99.
That's it. Right. This isn't about getting clients. This isn't about, um, like, you know,
leave them goes out to churches and like, it's not about any niches. It's about how many people,
how many appointments, how many phone calls can you make?
Three and a half, four years ago, I had a hundred people on my team
and I got really serious about volume. I got really serious about making a hundred phone calls a day.
That was my thing. I was like, I don't care what I do. I'm making a hundred phone calls a day.
And I want you to know that it takes two hours to make a hundred phone calls a day. And, and we're
going to talk about how to get those, those people to call, but, but two hours a day changed my career
in the next 12 months. I went from a hundred people to 550 people from simply making a hundred
phone calls a day. Uh, my income went from 300,000 to 700,000 in one year. Um, and here we are today,
you know, we've got, you know, somewhere around 3000 people in our organization.
Um, and, and just remember three, three and a half, four years ago, I was probably around where
some of you guys are at. So when, when Leland says, you're not that far, you're closer than you
think you are. I just want you guys to know somebody told me that and I believed it. So there's a part of
this where you've got to have faith. You've got to be naive enough to believe, right? And then you've
got to put the work behind it. So let's get rolling. I'm going to go through this pretty quick.
So there's volume growth talk and there's volume repellent talk. And, and we'll go through this.
So one thing that I noticed when, when I was writing this, I'm like, God, like, why does it look like
the font is smaller on the volume growth talk? And there's like this whole like story of the
repellent talk because it takes more work. It takes more excuses to make repellent talk. And I,
and I noticed that because I literally checked the font. I'm like, is it the same font? And it's the
same size font. So check this out. So, uh, if everybody spoke this way, I recruit three to five
people per month for years. So that was me. I'm like, Hey, I'm just going to recruit three to five
people a month for years. Right. I'm going to go do this for the next three to five years. I'm going
to go do this for the next three to five years. I never said, I'm going to go do this for the next
three to five weeks or months. Right. It was going to be years. I understood the long-term game.
Uh, number two is I'm going to do, I'm going to do this big and fast. Like I love, I, uh, obviously
Leland was the previous speaker. So it was like, it's fresh in my mind, but like, I just wanted to be
somebody. I just wanted to be somebody, you know, like I, I, I just, because of, you know, the, the
three letter, uh, companies, but like you walk into CVS and I was, nobody knows who I am, but a GFI
I'm somebody. Right. So like, that was a big deal for me. Number three is, uh, I'm in the talent
acquisition business. Do you guys understand that that's the business you're in? It's about going out
there and finding talent. Right. Um, some of you don't realize that you've got to perform like your
life depends on it. The truth is, is if your life dependent on it and I said, Hey, you got to go,
you know, Gustavo, you got to go recruit a hundred people this year. I guarantee you Gustavo would go
recruit a hundred people this year. Um, it's really important that you focus on this stuff.
Number four is, uh, I make a hundred phone calls a day, a hundred calls a day, two hours a day.
I guarantee you there are two hours a day that you're not doing anything.
Otherwise you wouldn't be on this call. You would be on the MVP call, right?
I, um, I'm going to build a big base shop. I'm sorry. I, I think I missed, I do five to 10
appointments a day. We're in the, we're, we're in the appointment business. So if you think about this,
like, do you know any doctors or lawyers or CPAs or hairdressers or mechanics or anybody that works
on appointment basis that is successful, that doesn't have appointments. Most of you are trying
to become successful with very few appointments. Thus you're, you're, you're having, it's creating
doubt because you're not getting the volume in that you need. Um, number six is I'm going to build a big
base shop. Everything good happens from a big base shop. You want to get promoted, build a big base shop.
You want to make big income, build a big base shop. You want to promote EMDs, build a big base shop.
If you look at all the people that build big, that, that promoted out EMDs, the only thing they have in
common is that they recruit in high volumes, they license in high volumes and they have big base shop
shops. That's basically the ingredient to promote now to EMDs.
I submit apps every day. You submit apps every day. You should be submitting 10, 15, 20 apps a week.
If you're building a big base shop and you're direct recruiting and you're tap rooting,
you should be submitting apps every single day. Um, more recruits equals more sales,
more licenses equals more money. Now let's, let's listen to this language. I don't recruit many
people because I'm selective. Have you guys ever said that? That is the repellent to growing a big
base shop. Like, let me ask you something. You think when somebody recruited Matt Welsh at 19 years
old, they were selective. He ends up being the greatest builder in our company, in the industry at this time.
You think somebody, when they recruited Eric Olson at 19 years old, were selective. He's literally the
greatest builder of all time. So think about this. Like, you know, I'm not saying go build a career.
I'm recruiting 19 year olds. I understand that there's one Eric Olson. There's Matt, one Matt
Welsh. There's one Mario Bayon. I understand that. You find those people through volume. You find them
when you go recruit a hundred people a month, boom, there's one Matt Welsh. But you know what,
what comes with one Matt Welsh? 25 other people that are ready to build. 25 other people that are
building. 25 other people that are getting license. So I think that's really important to understand.
Number two is I'm going to do, I'm going to wait on recruiting others until I know everything so I
can train them. Right? How about you recruit a bunch of people so you have a lot of people to train,
so you actually know how to train people. Right? It's easier to learn how to ride a bike by riding
the bike than reading a book about how to ride a bike. I don't need all this rah-rah in all these
meetings. Anybody ever say that? I just want you to know, you need it the most. Right? You need it the
most. If anybody thinks that, you need it the most. And just to let you guys know, it's not for you,
it's for your teams. It's not for you, it's for your future Matt Welsh. It's for your future
Tavares Dove. Right? It's for your future people that are going to become seven and eight figure earners.
How about this? How can I have success faster besides recruiting?
Yeah, you could join a different business, right? That doesn't require recruiting.
Right? Recruiting to our business. Like if this was a coal engine,
recruiting is the coal to the engine. Right? So I want you guys to understand, you could do this a
million ways. You could do leads. You could do advanced planning. You could do door knocking.
You could do flyers. You could recruit agencies. You could do it a million ways.
But if you want to go promote a bunch of EMDs, if you want to become an EMD, a part of this requires
you to understand recruiting. I only want to work with specific professionals. For example,
real estate agents, CPAs, military, right? How about you work with all of them? How about you work with
all of them? Like think about Matt's team. Matt's team not only has people in certain professions,
they have divisions of certain professions, right? Like how are you going to be able to build a diverse
environment when you're only going after one type of person?
Um, I don't need to read books or work on myself. And then competing isn't for me. Competing isn't my
thing. So I just want to let you guys know, if you're not in the top five of the leader board,
like on the leader's board every single month, nobody knows who you are. I challenge you to become
relevant. I challenge you to, to become somebody. And you know what, whatever it is that you feel like
you can compete with or compete in, go compete. All right. Volume licensing is the game every
single time. I'm going to go through this pretty quickly. I've got about four or five minutes.
Your intention with how you envision recruiting and team building will be your biggest reason
or your biggest obstacle. Megan hit this on the head on the, the nail on the head where she talked
about this isn't for you to do by yourself. It's for you to recruit people, get them to CFT. And,
you know, it's not your job to hold their hand to the finish line. It's their finish line to get to,
right? Like when I recruit somebody, so if I recruited you, Christy Ray, I would make sure
that you knew how to, how to, how to run the business and that you got licensed and that you
became independent. And then it is up to you to do the work to get to that next level.
Right. So it's really, really important that you guys understand that when you recruit somebody,
do you recruit to recruit or do you recruit to build? Right. I remember I recruited to recruit
for many, many years. It was, I was so caught up in the competitive nature of myself that I just
recruited people. And I was like, I'm the best recruiter. I'm the best recruiter, but you know
what I was? I was the worst licensor. Right. So, um, quick story, Matt and I started about the same
time. He was 19. I was 39. And, uh, and, um, we both got to about a quarter million dollars in
income about the same time. And, um, all of a sudden Matt and Allie, you know, started posting,
you know, like we're at 500,000, we're at 750,000, we're at a million dollars. And I'm still at 300,000.
And, uh, I remember telling my wife going, they're lying. There's no way like they're making this up.
And, um, I found out that they weren't lying. And I remember talking to Matt and going, Hey dude,
like you can't be this much better than me. And he said, you know what the difference is? He goes,
we're in two different businesses. You're in the, you're in the, you're in the recruiting business.
I'm in the licensing business. We were both running volume recruiting. He was just getting way more
people licensed. And then he asked me, he goes, well, what's your recruit to license ratio?
And I'm like, I don't know. And he goes, well, you better go figure that out. And you know what
I found out is that I was at a 7% recruit to license ratio. So for every hundred people that I
recruited, only seven got licensed. So every single month I was just recruiting to replace.
And that's some of your guys' business. And you're in the same place I was three and a half years ago
where I didn't understand that. And then Matt goes, do you know how much you make per person?
And I'm like, no, I don't know. And he goes, well, you better go figure that out. And
let me go over that for you guys. Now, just real quick, I'm going to kind of skip this,
skip three here, but the average license agent will make you $4,000 a year. So I remember telling Matt,
hey, so you're telling me if I go get a hundred new licenses next year, I can make an extra $400,000.
And he goes, yeah, Sparky, right? Like, you know, he goes, yes. So I, I went and I don't know if you
guys recall, I went and made about 30,000 phone calls that year and went from a hundred licensed
agents to a 550 licensed agents. And my income went from 300,000 to 750,000 in one year. Right?
So understanding the numbers is important. So we'll go through this pretty quick, pretty quick. So if
you went and did 20 base recruits, stop talking about it and start doing it. Stop talking about
it and start doing it. It's not that much work. 20 base recruits, you retain five per month,
five per month, the 60 licenses, licensed agents per year. Stop looking at it. So linear, right?
Start looking at the exponential growth and the non ceiling type business that we're in.
Uh, the average license agent will make you $4,000 per year. So how about you increase your income
by $240,000 a year by getting 60 licensed agents? The average license agent agent will produce 15,000
points per year. That's 900,000 points per year. That's $225,000 in override at a 25% override.
Thus you need to get to an EMD contract. So you have that override. That's not including the bonuses.
Do you guys understand? Like, do you understand that we're like last month with our bonuses,
our bonus, I'm sorry, our bonuses were over a hundred thousand dollars.
Bonuses were over a hundred thousand dollars. So when we're telling you to go become an EMD and build
EMDs, all we're telling you is don't make some more money and change your life. And think about this
in a five year snapshot, 300 licensed agents will equal $1.2 million in personal income with almost
90 plus percent of that being override. Who doesn't want that, right? Who doesn't want that? So I, I'm,
I'm going to finish up here in one second here, but I just want to let you guys know that if this guy
could do it, you could do it. I drove Uber 13 years ago. So if you're, if you have a job,
if you're driving Uber, if you're unsure of, if you could do this, I'm going to tell you guys just
a couple of things, work on your character, right? People want to follow people they like and people
they love and people they trust, but more importantly, get to work, get super clear on what
you want to do, write down your goals, laminate them, put them in your shower, read them every day
and go kick some butt, like go become an EMD already. Like really, that's my talk to you. Like
go become an EMD already. Stop making reasons why you're not an EMD and go become one. It is
discounted. It's easier today to become an EMD than any other time before. I love you guys.
And I love this company. This isn't, this isn't what I do. This is who I am. And I hope that you
guys take that and like embody that and make it who you are. Have a great Saturday. Have a great Sunday.
And we love you.
Uri, what a message, brother. What a message. By the way, I love that closing comment. This is not
what I do. This is who I am. And those that can step into that are going to go so much further
than people that just have, or this is just something that they do. This is just a way that
they earn income. This is just a way that they do business. And you're saying like, no, this is who I
am. Like I am this person all the time. I am this leader all the time. I operate with this integrity
all the time. I show up for my friends. I show up as a leader. I show up for my family. I am this person
all the time. This isn't something I do. This is part of who I am. And I want to encourage you guys
to operate that way. I want to encourage you guys to operate that way. That's why I was
so hard to get Tom Brady out of football. That's why you look at Lionel Messi still playing to this
day. No matter, LeBron James just keeps on going because he said, you know what? And I'm not even
a LeBron James fan, but he just keeps on going because basketball is part of who he is. He just
loves it so much that he's willing to figure out a way to stay in the game because it's not something
he does. It's something that means something to him. Like what you're even just talked about,
you know, guys, you've talked about volume right now, increasing your volume. You're looking at
somebody with a top base shop, a top super base, a top super team made $240,000 last month.
Do you think he might have a slight idea of what's required to win? So we can either look at what he
said today and say, you know what? I'm going to try to figure out an easier route. I'm going to try to
do this without running high volume, which would be a mistake. Or you can look at everything that he
said and said, you know what? The person that runs the biggest, the most volume wins. I'm going to go
increase my recruiting. I'm going to increase my licensing. And if I do those two things, I'm going
to blow this thing out of the water. You're what an incredible message, brother. Truly, truly
incredible. Guys, we have two speakers left in today. You got to hear from one senior partner just now.
And the final two people are two other senior partners. And we get to hear from Levi and then
Mario Bion is closing us out here today. And so I have the privilege to introduce Levi and Boney right now.
We call him the Black Panther Wakanda. We call him the Black Panther. And this guy has made such a
massive difference in my career. You know, you've talked about conversations that we had with licensing
and the same conversation I had with your Eve was the conversation Levi had with me. And so the,
it was just a passed on message. Levi gave me coaching and, and he gave me strategy and he put me
up on game and my whole business changed. And so I was like, your Eve, dude, I didn't know this.
You should do this. And your Eve applied it and it works. So what's my point is Levi gave me
information and it changed my career. All I did was pass that information to your Eve, your Eve,
and it changed his entire career. And so if you guys listen intently, it will change your entire
career as well. But let me tell you something about Levi. He's one of the most strategic minds that I've
ever had the opportunity to work alongside. And it's why I love being in boardrooms with them. It's why I
love being in business with him. Every time I'm with him, my mind just gets blown because he had,
he just thinks with so much strategy, he's a chess player and he's not just an incredible chess player.
He's great at making chess feel like checkers in order for other people to win. But he's an incredible
husband. He's an incredible man. He's an incredible leader. Guys, imagine this. Imagine building a business
that does a hundred million points a year and you got a 93% persistency. That's exactly what this man
has done. And to have him as a board member of this great company, helping steer the entire company.
It's one of the greatest privileges of my career, getting to wake up every day and go work alongside
him. If you guys can do me a favor, please give it up for the executive chairman, top builder in all
the financial services, the one and only Mr. Levi and Boney.
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Thank you, Matt. Thank you so much. More grateful to be in business with you
than ever. Thank you. Everyone being on this call today, guys, everyone else that has, you know,
talk before me have done my job today. Very, very easy. You know why they've shared everything that
you needed to know, right from Tavares Dove opening the call all the way to pastor Leland,
my brother from another mother, right? They've done it all. Megan, you're my fan girl. The first time I
come across this young lady was when I was asked to, you know, um, coordinate a call at the NLA
and they said, Megan, I said, who is Megan members? So, wow, this lady, she's, and, uh, you know,
since then it's been a rollercoaster of looking at this lady's number. I hope you guys could feel her
heart. I hope you guys can feel her heart because sometimes when these people come and speak,
you guys think they're bluffing, but the result is a reflection of what they have in the heart for
the community that they serve. That's it. That's what separates a lot of people. What is in your heart?
I promise you, if you came here with the intention, I'm just going to make some money.
You're going to retire fast. You know why you're going to make the money? Then what?
Or you wouldn't even make the money because you're going to experience so much frustration
along the way. You're going to quit. But if you come here because you've experienced something
that you say, you know what? I need to go and be a difference maker. I need to go and make a
difference in my community. I need to go and make a difference with my people. Then it becomes a
different ball game. The money comes by default. The money comes by default. And so I say this to say
that all of us have come here with doubt on our mind. Can I even do this? Oh my God, you hear
somebody speak. Can I ever be good at that? I was the biggest introvert you could ever imagine.
If speaking was part of the requirement to recruit, I would not even be a recruiter.
But guess what? Over the time, because my mind and the vision that I had was bigger than my little
challenge of not talking to people, I had to overcome that. I still struggle with that.
Right? I sit in a group of people. Everybody would talk. I'm just listening because,
you know, it wasn't my thing talking. But guess what, guys? Guess what?
when I finally knew what I wanted to talk to.
or talk about, I start talking.
You guys get it?
Now you know what to talk about if you were an introvert like me.
There is something to talk about now.
And so, my conversation today is to talk to you guys
about inspecting what you expected.
And if you hear a field chairman says,
oh my gosh, my business changed because I had a conversation.
And I remember that day on the deck
at Eric Orson's log cabin in California at Bay Valley.
And that was because I loved this young man so much.
He was doing volume recruiting.
He was great at what he was doing,
but the results was not reflected.
I said, man, what are you doing?
And we had a conversation.
You probably are not doing a volume recruiting right now
or doing volume business right now.
That's why you're not inspecting.
But we encourage you to do it
because that's exactly what Eurif just did.
Eurif just said, I was recruiting.
I was doing everything.
But Matt's numbers, Matt just keep, you know,
smoking me in all areas.
And for one moment, I said, he's lying.
The numbers are not real.
That is the truth.
Most people think the numbers are not real.
Guess what?
It was the same thing with me.
I was so frustrated in my business, Jacob.
I was so frustrated.
What was going on?
I had to one day literally pull Eric on the side
and say, what the heck?
How many licensed pediatrics do you have in your base shop?
Because I was looking at a million point base shop
and for three years,
I was striving to get a million point base shop
and I wouldn't get a million point base shop.
Even when I thought I did all my best,
I was earning at 960,000 points.
And then when he gave me the stack,
he said, what is your licensing ratio?
I said, what is licensing ratio?
Right?
He said, true story.
And so, if you have already done the work
or you've been doing the work
and you've not been matching the ratios
and frustration is kicking in
and then you take these ratios and put it in,
game over.
If you haven't, good news.
You can start right from the beginning
overcoming the mistakes we made.
How did Megan get to go to a million point in year one?
It took me three years of working hard
to try to get a million point base shop
and after having the conversation about ratio,
I left from a million to two million
to three million to four million point,
around a four million point base shop
promoting 10 EMDs out of my base shop every year.
Do these ratios matter?
They do.
They do.
So, please pay attention to them
because they do.
Right?
Yurif just said it.
How did Matt win
crushing all these numbers
and he is doing the same recruiting volume
and he's having nothing?
Yurif, 7% licensing ratio.
Congratulations, brother.
I was at 5%
when the reality call kicked in.
If all of us are speaking,
Yurif was not in our organization
at that time.
He was in another hierarchy.
If all of us are speaking the language,
can you at least understand what's going on
so you can apply that language to your business?
Can you just take all these experiences
and apply to yourself
so you don't make the same mistake?
It took us years to figure this out.
You guys are still EMDs.
Can you believe what a smooth ride you have
if you just apply some of this stuff?
I left from being that, you know,
guy struggling to make a million point base shop
to go having one of the biggest base shops
in the company,
second base shop ever in the whole company
and promoting 10 EMDs.
Why?
Having a mastery of the ratios.
So, please, as we say this,
I need you to pay attention.
So, there were two things.
There are two things I'm going to talk to you guys today.
Everybody has talked about it.
Now, our CEO said,
hey, when every speaker speaks,
please make sure you get one golden nugget.
But some of these golden nuggets
become common denominators.
Are you finding some common denominators
to go highlight?
If you're really speaking about volume business,
if Pastor Leland is speaking about volume business,
if I'm speaking about volume business,
are these words becoming common denominators for you
that every single leader is talking about it?
I need to pay attention.
Yes or yes.
That's how you make a difference in your business.
Besides picking every nugget,
what are those common denominators
that you can use to accelerate the process?
So, the common denominators,
I read a book earlier in my career.
Listen to this very well.
I read a book earlier in my career
and it was a leader in an organization
that has gone out and interviewed
20 leaders in the company
as to how they became,
where they become the biggest leaders.
And one of the questions is asked
every single one across the board
was if you were to start all over,
what would you do differently?
And that question became a changing moment in my business.
Every single one of the big leaders said,
I would have bought into this recruiting thing
from the world go.
I would have bought into this recruiting thing.
I would have accepted that recruiting,
volume recruiting is the name of the business.
If everyone and all these guys you had interviewed
had put in 10, 15, 20 years in the business,
their underlining issue was that
if they had bought into the recruiting game earlier,
they would have had an excellent business.
So I went back and I said,
all right, then I need to accept this recruiting
because their regrets was my fertilizer,
was my fuel for growth.
While they were regretting that,
they took all these years to accept that recruiting
was the answer.
I then accepted from day one
that volume recruiting was the thing.
That's why the first area that I focus on
when I trade is called massive recruiting.
Massive recruiting.
Massive recruiting.
Some of you will get it.
Some of you will get it on the way home.
But those of you who get it,
massive recruiting is the name of the game.
Every other thing rise and fall
without massive recruiting.
Now, the second is what?
It's not to go master the ratios
because without that volume in recruiting,
every other thing we're talking about here
is of no value.
It's of no value.
So after massive recruiting,
then what do you do?
Massive licensing.
That is what Yurif just talked about.
I was having a 5% licensing ratio
because I knew how to recruit,
but I didn't understand anything about distribution.
Look at me.
You are in the distribution of financial services
and therefore you need more distribution outlets.
You need more distribution outlets.
Period.
Some people get it right off the bat.
Some people don't get it.
Right?
So, I have a young lady
that came into my organization
from the practice company.
We used to be in sight lines over the years.
Right?
Her name is Georgette.
Georgette came in
and we're having a conversation.
It said, Levi,
I saw you on the sideline exploding.
What exactly did you do?
Because that's exactly what I want to do.
I said,
we can go talk about 20 other things that I did.
But the number one,
number one,
number one thing is
volume recruiting.
And that volume recruiting
starts with you doing DDR.
You need to start with 10 minimum
in order to even think.
Without 10,
we're not having this conversation.
She went and got 15 in her first month in business.
Or is it 18?
18 in her first month in business.
I said, you got it.
Guys, listen to me very well.
My topic today is not volume recruiting.
But what I'm going to talk about,
if there is no volume coming in,
it's not going to work.
So, volume is the name of the game.
Volume is the name of the game.
And so, when you start recruiting in volume,
everything else change.
I have another young lady
that came to my organization
from Southern California.
Oh, Levi.
So, what do I need to do?
Because I've done this.
And I said, listen, girl.
Right?
She and her husband,
Beatrice and Williams.
I said, listen.
You can tell me how cute you are.
You can tell me how many years
you've been in the business.
Tell me how many years you've been in PHP.
I'm not interested.
What you need to do,
I need you to go do volume recruiting.
When you start doing volume recruiting,
we can have the conversation.
They went and had 12 recruit,
their first one in business with me.
Are you guys getting the message?
You want to grow this pie?
I need you to talk about volume recruiting.
We just promoted, you know,
an organic EMD.
Trevor Rose Dove just promoted
an organic EMD called,
you know, Natalie Taylor.
She was in my house in March.
March of this year.
And she said, oh my gosh,
coach, I got it.
I said, what?
He said, this thing is not going to work
if there's no volume.
She's today at 270,000 in cash flow
from March.
She's an EMD.
She's about to blow.
Are you guys getting it?
Numbers don't lie.
People do.
So when you accept volume recruiting,
everything else is going to fall in place.
You guys get it?
Good.
That was not my topic.
My topic was,
after you get the volume recruiting,
then what?
For you to get those volume recruiting,
what do you need to do?
Listen to me.
Look at me.
You need to have sub-systems.
Triple-digit recruiting
is 100 recruit in a month
in your organization.
Absolutely nothing to do
with your downline,
your sideline,
your upline.
It has everything to do with you.
You're not going to go run
100 recruiting in your business,
TDR,
because you want it.
You need to run some sub-systems.
How about you focus the next quarter
to getting 10 MDs
in your little base,
to getting 5 MDs
in your little base,
and having each one of them
go do 10?
That would be 50.
You guys get it?
Run sub-systems.
Once that is done,
and then,
we're going to get into
volume business.
When you get into volume,
master these few ratios.
There are 12 different ratios
like Eric talked about.
Last Thursday,
I was talking about it.
If we're talking about it
over and over,
the sea ring a bell
about the importance of that,
I'm just going to work
with 5 of them for you.
These 5,
I call them
the money-making ratios.
The money-making ratios.
Alright?
I'm going to share my screen.
If I pay it,
I'm going to share my screen here,
show you these ratios,
and we close it out.
It's easy.
These 5 ratios here,
I call them
the money-making ratios.
And the reason I call them
the 5 money-making ratios,
is because these ratios
are designed,
they are designed to
multiply everything
that you're doing.
Number 1,
number 1,
number 1,
is called persistency.
The quality of business
you write.
Right?
Teva technology is here.
Thank you,
Jesus.
Thank you,
Eric Austin,
for wisdom.
You can now see
the amount of business
that is falling off the book
right on your dashboard.
Amazing!
Amazing!
Right?
And so,
we say that
that persistency,
that quality of business,
which is the amount of business
that stays
versus the one
that falls off the book.
The business that stays
is the business that pays.
Why would you want to do the work
and then don't get paid for it?
And we put it here,
once you fall below 85%,
you're in the red zone.
First of all,
we even make it so that
when you get to certain levels,
you don't even get bonuses
in the company
because why are you getting bonuses
for writing bad business?
It's your responsibility
to make sure that
the business you write
stays on the books.
Quality business.
And so,
what are some of the things to do?
Be in the right market.
You need the right market.
What is the right market?
The macho market.
Right?
You know,
don't oversell.
I know your quest
to make money is high,
but if you miss
proper selling,
the client have the tendency
to charge back.
That is the tendency
to let the policy fall off.
Right?
Do some annual funding.
Right?
Annual premiums,
annual premiums,
annual premiums.
When the client have a skin
that they gain,
the chance for them
to shut down the policy
is linked to nothing.
You're not selling peanuts.
Listen to me.
My client say,
well,
so how am I going to do this monthly?
I say,
ma'am,
sir,
don't you have enough bills
in your life?
I'm not coming here
to add bills in your life.
Right?
I'm not,
I'm not Tampa Energy.
I'm not Tampa Water Corporation.
I am here to help you save money.
I'm here to help you
increase the discipline to save.
So,
you need to put this amount of money
up front at the end.
Write some annuities.
Right?
Get your partners properly trained
to represent you in the marketplace.
And please talk about it.
The language you speak in your house
is the language your babies
are going to understand.
Are you speaking the language
of good persistency in your business?
What language are you speaking?
Because if people are not writing
good business,
you're not speaking the language
of persistency.
I need to speak that language.
Right?
Number two
is the points per recruit.
The points per recruit.
Every single individual
that comes in your organization,
the expectation
is that you're going to generate
a minimum of 5,000 points
from that individual.
5,000 points.
Right?
Save that technology again this year.
I look at right on my screen.
It says points per recruit.
6,800.
I say bingo.
If I'm having 6,800,
you know,
for points per recruit,
awesome.
Why?
Because the minimum standard
of excellence in my mind
is not even 3,000,
it's 5,000.
So when you measure
the production per recruit,
then you can easily have
what I call
a predictable business.
How do you do that again?
Be in the right market.
Do the five-finger solution.
Multiple apps per household.
Get some competent trainers
on the field.
Get some CFTs
so they can close good business.
Run a tight system.
Meaning that what?
You actually need to have
an assistant
that will measure
these ratios.
Track these ratios.
I have an unbelievable assistant.
I told her,
I said,
you need to create
a tracking,
you know,
a system
that you're going to complement
where you're tapping from
Teva
because I need to seal visually.
You know why?
Because I want
a predictable business.
Next ratio,
right?
The licensing ratio.
We cannot overemphasize
on the licensing ratio.
Listen to this.
How this blows my mind.
Right?
We,
we,
we're topping up.
We're topping up.
You know,
and every single time,
my guys,
Levi,
what do you do?
I said,
I just license people more.
And we're in the car
in Hawaii
heading to the airport
with one of the biggest
leader in Canada
who would be in business
for like 15 years.
And,
he said,
Levi,
it's just amazing
at what speed
you guys are going.
You know,
your production
almost tripled my production.
I've been here for 15 years.
What exactly are you doing?
I didn't even hesitate.
I said,
the only thing I think
in my mind
without even thinking
is that I must have
outlicensed you.
I said,
what do you mean?
I said,
how many licenses do you have?
Guys,
with no stain of a doubt
in my mind.
And guess what?
It was the truth
that I licensed him.
We went down
to the National Convention
they had shown
cash flow ratings
before
and I'm at the back
of the stage
to wire to speak
and they said,
great leader
that was behind me
had been in the business
for 27 years.
We had just passed them
in cash flow that year.
And they said,
my gosh,
Levi,
amazing.
You're nine years
in the business,
right?
I said,
yes.
He said,
how on earth
did he make more money
than me?
And I've been here
27 years
and I'm considered
one of the greatest
builders.
I said,
well,
the only thing
that I think
that I must have done
is that I must have
outlicensed you.
Come to checkout,
boom,
I've outlicensed him.
Can you get your business
to the point
where you can predict
why and that you can
state exactly
why you're leading?
That is the number
of license.
Why?
I have more distribution
outlet on the field.
Guys,
some of you are going
to get this on,
as we say this,
as some of you won't.
But my greatest wish
is that every one
of you should get it.
The more licensed
people you get,
the rest and training
all of that,
the more distribution
outlet you get out there.
That's one of the most
powerful tool here
is getting more
distribution outlet.
Next is what?
Points per license.
Damn.
Everyone says
20,000 per license.
What if you take it
to 50,000?
Teva just came up.
Again,
I keep saying Teva
because,
you know,
all the work
I did manually
over the years,
struggling,
scratching every single
note and every single
thing,
Teva just put it
in front of me.
So I don't even
need to struggle.
It's right there.
Instead of me
trying to figure it out,
it's already done
for me and it's
sitting right there.
It's sitting right there.
Right?
It's sitting right there.
And so,
I want to say this,
20,000 per
licensed agent
per year.
That is cute
when we didn't
have technology.
That is cute
when we didn't
have instant approval.
That is cute
when we didn't
have Zoom.
That is,
we're still taking
these numbers
that we operated
from
Daikin.com
and we're bringing
them to you now
just to give you
some baseline.
I just looked at
on my computer,
it says
27,
28,700
per license
agent.
My goal
is to move it
to 50,000.
You measure,
listen,
they say
performance
is improved
when performance
is measured.
These are the
stats for you
to measure.
I cannot
overemphasize.
So,
the more production
you get
per licensed agent,
the more money
you're going to
make,
period.
And last
but not the least,
you guys must
have seen this
before,
net licensing
ratio.
Net license
ratio.
How many of
the licensed
people,
did you actually
get to make
their first
thousand dollars
so that we
can increase
retention?
Hey guys,
I can talk
here all day,
but my
time is up.
I hope that
the message
will pass
today.
Hope you
guys start
tracking from
day one.
Volume business
and tracking
is what you
need to go
to the next
level.
And we
can't wait
to welcome
you guys
on the
other side
as EMDs
and the next
EMDs of
this organization.
I give it
back to the
best field
chairman ever
in the history
of financial
services,
Mr.
Matthew Welsh.
Goodness
gracious,
Levi,
I am
Boney.
Can you
guys see
why we
call him
the Black
Panther?
Can you
see why?
Because this
guy's a
magician when
it comes to
the business
and being
able to help
people grow
and scale.
Hopefully you
guys took
what he went
over and
in your
mind you're
thinking,
okay,
based off my
current numbers,
I can
mathematically
scale my
business.
You know,
one thing
that I
learned from
Mario
Bayona,
who I
get to
introduce
next,
is you
focus on
math over
man and
you focus on
numbers over
names.
The man
and the
names will
eventually
reveal
themselves as
people that
you are in
business with
for the rest
of your
life,
but you have
to be willing
to run
the numbers
and do
the math
in order
to grow
and scale.
And that's
exactly what
Levi just
went over,
was the
numbers and
math that's
required in
order for you
to scale,
in order for
you to
grow.
Okay?
All of
those numbers,
just to give
you guys an
idea,
those ratios,
those metrics,
I didn't learn
any of those
for about five
years of being
in the industry.
And you guys
are getting
that in the
Bay Shop.
So imagine
the foundation
of what you
have the
opportunity to
build because
of the ratios,
because of the
metrics,
because of the
numbers that
Levi just
went over.
We need to
obsess about
them and if
we obsess
about them,
we will
grow them.
Levi,
absolutely
incredible
message,
brother.
How many
of you guys
want to hear
from our
closing out
speaker today?
Anybody?
Mario Bayona?
You guys
know him
and Lisa
just celebrated
their nine-year
wedding anniversary
two days ago
and they're
logging in
in order to
be on a
call with you
guys.
Just celebrated
nine years
married.
And what's
also really
cool is on
their wedding
anniversary,
they've officially
crossed $4
million a year
in annual
income.
Talk about
an anniversary
direct deposit
present.
I think that's
pretty awesome.
but just
crossed $4
million in
income as
the leader
of GFI
Lionstar.
And let me
tell you
something,
their organization
is absolutely
crushing it.
They're about
to cross
30 million
points per
year.
Anybody want
a 30 million
point business?
Anybody?
Well, that's
what their
organization is
crossing as we
speak.
He is a
leader of
leaders.
He's an
incredible
husband.
He's an
amazing dad.
to see the
way he's
walking in
his faith
is unbelievable.
And just
as the human
being he is,
you know,
throughout my
career,
Mario has
always been
somebody that
has inspired
me.
When I was
coming up in
this business,
I had something
called Goat
Mountain.
And Goat
Mountain was
those that I
looked to when
it came to
public speaking,
when it came
to the business.
And Mario
was and is on
that mountain
for me as
somebody that I
looked to for
strategy,
looked to for
partnership.
He makes me
better in
every single
way.
And the fact
that I get to
be in business
with them and
be in life
with him is
incredible.
Lisa, his
amazing wife,
is just as
powerful as
him, if not
more powerful.
And I love
the fact that
my wife and
his wife are
incredible
friends.
Guys, I want
you to know
that as you
build this
business, you're
not just
building a
company, you're
building a
life.
And the people
that you get
to do it
around and be
around matters.
And the fact
that I get to
wake up every
day and go
build a business
with this man
brings so much
joy to my
life.
And Mario, I
just want you
to know that.
Brother, I love
you.
I'm grateful for
you.
I'm so proud of
what you guys
are doing.
The fact that
we get to do
this together
is incredible.
Do me a
favor and
please give it
up for one
of the top
builders to
ever step
foot into
our industry.
Somebody who
genuinely cares
and somebody
who is a
leader of
leaders.
The one and
only Mr.
Mario Bayona.
All right.
Awesome.
Matt, I
appreciate it.
I'm going to
get to my
topic.
It's been a
great meeting.
I've been
listening to it
most of it
on the road.
Plans
changed.
There's
tornado
warnings in
Nashville.
So our
travel got a
little bit
derailed.
And we're
in the airport
and we're
trying to
catch a
flight home.
And I
might miss
this flight
to be on
this call.
But I
wanted to
start with
one simple
message.
I want you
to write
this down.
You need
to develop
a whatever
it takes
mentality.
Not a
whatever is
comfortable
mentality.
If
everything
goes
according
to me
and the
weather
is
perfect,
I'm
going to
get the
job
done
mentality.
I
want you
to
develop
a
whatever
it takes
mentality.
This is
the fourth
laptop I
grabbed.
The last
three died
in the
call.
I am
plugged in
right now.
This is
hilarious.
I don't
even know
if you
can see
this.
This is
at the
airport,
the machine
that dispenses
the boarding
passes.
There's
people literally
getting their
boarding pass
next to me
as I'm
speaking to
you and
I'm doing
this call.
You want
to know
why?
Because we
do whatever
it takes
to get
the job
done.
It's a
mentality
that I
learned early
on in my
career.
By the
way,
as funny
as I'm
professional,
I don't
care how
you look
at it,
I just
learned one
thing,
that when
I set
my mind
to something
that I'm
going to
get something
done,
I will
go to
any extent
as long
as it's
legal,
ethical,
and moral
to get
it done.
When you
take a
look at
a guy
like me
who's
average
and
ordinary,
who grows
up in
Mexico,
who doesn't
speak
English,
and happens
to build
a pretty
decent
business
in this
industry,
and you
go,
what does
that guy
got that
other guys
don't got?
Or what
does that
person have
that person
do?
I was
just
willing to
take it
a little
bit further
than anybody
else.
I was
just
willing to
do it
when it
sucked.
My mom
is having
heart surgery
on Tuesday.
I will
appreciate
your prayers.
It's open
heart surgery.
It's going
to be a
massive thing.
In the midst
of we have
tons of
trouble with
the team and
with the
company and
all the
stuff that
we've got
to do.
We're flying
family from
Mexico from
different parts
so they can
be there for
my mom.
I can't
be there
for my
mom.
When the
mission is
so big and
when this is
purpose-driven
versus just
income-driven,
you do whatever
it takes to
get the job
done.
I just
want to
encourage
everybody.
You got
to get to
EMD.
You want
to know
why?
If you
don't
get to
EMD,
you're
going to
be in
someone's
base
shop for
the rest
of your
career.
There's
a way
to do
it.
With all
the things
we've
learned
today,
one of
the things
you've
got to
do is
develop
whatever
it takes
mentality.
I want
to continue
this on
because this
is one of
the things
I like to
say all
the time
to myself.
It's one
of the
things I
say a lot
when I'm
speaking.
I am a
lot closer
than I
think I
am.
I want
you guys
to practice
that as
I say
it.
I want
you to
repeat
it.
I
cannot
hear
you
because
you're
muted.
I am
a lot
closer
than I
think I
am.
Matter of
fact,
say to the
person that
is in the
square next
to you,
turn to the
square next
to you and
tell them,
hey, I'm
a lot
closer than
I think
I am.
Turn to
the one
on top,
the one
that has
been throwing
you some
bad air.
I want
to encourage
you.
That becomes
an affirmation
that you
say every
single day.
Here's the
thing.
There's two
ways you can
get to EMD.
I want you
to hear me.
You can build
your way to
EMD or
you can
produce your
way to
EMD.
The vast
majority of
people
produce their
way to
EMD and
EMD
becomes
a promotion
that leads
to a pay
cut.
How many
of you
would like
to get
promoted so
you can
make less
money?
Any of you
here?
You want
to get
promoted
in English
again.
Some of you
raise your
hand all
the time
because you're
fired up.
I think
you need
to hear
it again
or you're
going to
feel really
dope.
How many
of you
want to
get a
promotion
just so
you can
experience
a pay
cut?
I'll put
my hand
down.
I need
to listen
right.
You don't
want to
get promoted
if you're
going to get
a pay cut.
the whole
point of
get a
pay.
It's
going to
make sense
for you
to get
to a
higher
level
and make
less.
Well,
here's
the thing.
I've
met a
lot of
people
that have
moved up
in
contract
and gone
down
in
cash flow.
The number
one reason
is because
they produced
their way
to a
promotion.
They didn't
build their
way to a
promotion.
When they
got to
the promotion,
they didn't
have the
infrastructure
that could
they didn't
have the
correct
infrastructure.
So when
they let
go of
the
exchange,
like when
they let
go of
that team
that they
were exchanging
in order
for them
to receive
their broker
position,
their momentum
died because
their promotion
was not built
on momentum,
it was built
on clients.
And when
they stopped
chasing those
clients to get
that promotion,
everything went
bad.
I personally
experienced a
little bit of
that and I
want to just
challenge everybody.
Produce your
way to EMD,
which leads
me to how
you can build
your way
to EMD.
You got to
act like an
EMD before
you're an
EMD.
How many of
you guys
have ever
heard of that
before?
You got to
act like an
EMD before
you're an
EMD.
What does
that mean,
Chris Harbaugh?
It sounds
cool, but
what?
I got to
wear a suit,
I got to
wear a
t-shirt with
a blazer
like everybody
did today
except
LeBan.
You can
tell they
were all
casual
until they
got on
the call
and they
threw
on a
blazer.
And our
CEO was
also in
a
business
but
everybody
else
is in
a
t-shirt
and a
blazer.
I'm the
guy in
the
t-shirt
that
didn't
have
a
blazer
because
it's
already
checked
in
and I
hope I
can
make it
to
Nashville
and I
apologize
for not
having a
blazer
on.
But
what the
heck
does
acting
like
an EMD
before
you're
an EMD
means?
Let me
tell you
what that
means.
You
need to
start
running
a
base
shop
inside
of
the
base
shop.
So
let me
change
my
camera.
I want
to show
you what
acting
like an
EMD
before
you're
an
EMD
looks
like.
Do you
guys see
that guy
right there?
That
is Robert
Morales.
He's on
another
soon
called
recruiting
his
10th
person
for
the
month
inside
my
base
shop.
He
built
a
whatever
it
takes
mentality.
Me
and
him
I
mess
our
flights
together
and
our
wives
I
get
international
without
us.
He's
hitting
EMD
this
month.
This
month
he'll
be
promoted
to
EMD.
Let
me
tell
a little
about
EMD
promotion.
He
averages
between
20
to
25
recruits
a
month.
He's
developed
three
marketing
directors
inside
of
his
thing.
His
cash
was
just
very
shy
of
$200,000.
Qualified
for
Hawaii
as
either
number
two
or
three
non
EMD
in
the
entire
company.
He
dominated
his
level.
He
qualified
for
Lions
Growth
Academy
as
the
number
one
person
in
our
entire
team
non
EMD.
That's
how you
get
to
a
promotion.
By
the
way,
he
was
trying
to
get
his
promotion
a
year
ago
this
time.
He
had
produced
his
way
to
that
and
had
no
business,
no
infrastructure
and
I
asked
them,
do
you
want
to
The way you go to EMD will be the story you'll share for the rest of your career with any person you ever promote to EMD.
I said, Robert, do you have an assistant right now?
The answer is no.
Do you run your own meeting after the meetings?
The answer is no.
Do you have role plays with your team every Sunday or on a weekly basis?
The answer is no.
Okay, let me, what's your licensing ratio?
I have no idea.
What's your, okay, so you want a title, but you're not ready to receive it.
I'm like, from here on forward to that, you are going to help me run my base shop.
You're going to do the follow-up.
So this, to me, is acting like an EMD before you are one.
Let me give you some tangible things.
One, you should have an assistant.
Well, I don't know if I can afford an assistant.
You cannot afford not to have an assistant.
Because if you don't have an assistant, that means you're inputting applications, you're doing manual paperwork, you're doing assistant work.
You're not an assistant.
You're going to be a freaking broker in the fastest growing financial company in the world.
You cannot afford to be doing that yourself.
Matter of fact, maybe if you hire someone, you'll start giving them some work to do, and you'll start writing up more sales because you've got to pay them.
Here's the truth.
You don't need to hire a physical assistant.
You need to hire a VA.
His VA, when he started, was $5 an hour.
Well, now he's got multiple VAs, and everything is taken care of.
Does that make sense?
So it's very affordable to have an assistant.
You need to have an assistant.
The next thing, if you think that in your mind, you're getting ready to be an EMD, this is what running your own base shop looks like.
You run meetings after the meetings with your team.
Are you running or hosting a weekly meeting, just you and your individual team?
Well, Mario, I'm going to Matthew Welsh's meeting.
Great.
When he finishes his meeting, you tell your team to stick around, and you then lead your team, and you guys go over what were the main topics.
You guys can discuss.
You guys can go over accountability, whatever the teams may be.
But you need to start having some practice, public speaking, in front of a group of people leading the charge, leading the troops in order for you to become an EMD.
Because you know what?
When you're an EMD, you're going to have to be out there on your own doing it.
And if you don't prepare now, you're not going to be ready later.
The third thing, the third thing that you got to do is you got to start doing role play sessions with your team.
If you're not an EMD, odds are you don't have a lot of people on your team that are certified field trainers, that are independent, that are very good.
Well, that's, no, that's not a problem.
The only problem is if you're not developing that.
Well, how do you develop that?
You begin to have a culture where every single Sunday or every Saturday or whatever, you begin to have role play sessions with your team, power hours with your team.
Your team starts getting to know each other.
Your team starts to have identity of its own.
Your team starts having to have some team pride, team ego inside the base shop so you guys can become the next EMD team in that base.
And next thing that you need to do, number four, you got to inspect your business.
You ought to know your ratios at any given moment.
If I was to say, what's your licensing ratio or what's your point per recruit ratio?
Odds are in your way to EMD, what's holding you back is one thing.
One of your ratios is really bad.
And that's why you're not an EMD yet.
Well, if you identify and become aware of what that ratio is, and then you can go to someone that's really good at it and you go, hey, I noticed that you're the best at point per recruit ratio.
Like we have a guy on Robert Morales' team.
His name is Doc Greed.
This guy's recruiting 10 to 13 people a month in his team.
This guy also does about 5,000 to 7,000 points a month.
So his point per recruit ratio is like 500 points.
That's the worst in GFI.
He's like number one from the bottom up in that ratio.
Does that make sense?
But now, if Doc Greed is aware of that, who's pretty new, and I believe he's going to be the next EMD as well, he can then go to, let's say, Arturo Murillo, who is the number one at that ratio.
And go, say, Arturo, I noticed that that ratio is your strength and that ratio is my weakness.
Question, what are some things that you do to increase your point per recruit ratio?
And then Arturo can go, well, this is what I'm doing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And then Doc can grab that information because that's what EMDs do.
They go become resourceful.
Is this true or not true?
Are you guys getting something out of this?
Or is this just like bluff?
Or is this just the end of the meetings?
Or are you just hanging on?
And you literally go and it's like you got to be intentional about your development and the areas that you need to improve on.
And the fifth thing that you need to do to act like an EMD before you're an EMD, Jarif touched on it.
He said, you run on volume.
Let me be more specific.
You have a double-digit mindset.
Everything is a double-digit mindset, my business.
Love how attentive you are.
Appreciate you.
Todd O'Brien, appreciate you, brother.
Looking sharp.
Hear me.
Please hear me.
Everything is double-digits.
How do I know you're ready to be an EMD?
Larry Zaron or Lisandro Lopez.
You're recruiting 10-plus people a month.
So I want you to grab it.
This is the double-digits that you should be doing.
And you should ask yourself, are you there yet?
And if not, get there.
Hear me.
It's not when you go, it's how you go.
It's not when you go to EMD, it's how you get to EMD.
It's not when you get to EMD, it's how you get to EMD.
I want you to hurry up and get there.
But it's not when you get there, it's how you get there.
So what are the double-digits you should be focused on?
You should be focused on double-digit recruiting per month every single month.
Number two, you should be doing double-digit personal applications every month.
Whether you are the writing agent or you're the split agent, there should be a minimum of 10 applications every month that have your name on it.
How can you develop closers if you yourself are not closing?
Number three, you've got to be on double-digit amount of appointments, 10-plus appointments every single week.
You want to be an EMD, right, Jacob Corson?
He's got the GFI dress code to the T, blazer with a T-shirt.
Also, you need double-digit attendance.
What does that mean?
When you host your team meeting or you have your meeting after the meeting, do you have 10-plus people in that meeting?
If the answer is no, you want to grow to it.
What makes a business predictable?
Attendance leads to predictability.
Follow me, Christy, right?
So this is the basic rule of thumb when you run a volume business.
For every person that's showing up to your meetings, you're going to equal about one application a month.
For every person that shows up to your meetings, you're going to average one recruit a month.
So if I want to recruit 20 people next month, I know that if I can grow to 20 people coming to meetings, that can lead me into 20 recruits and 20 sales a month business in a very predictable way without spiking and then dipping.
So I just want to challenge everybody.
You've got to start running double digits.
Everything you do has got to start becoming double digits.
If you're not there, it's perfectly fine.
That's where we're hosting this call.
You're going to make a commitment for you to change so you can get to double digits.
And remember what I said earlier.
You're closer than you think you are.
You can go from having three people showing up to your meeting to 10 people showing up to your meeting in a matter of two weeks.
If you just focus on helping people get their three and three, get promoted, you work with their new people, you get them licensed.
Next thing you know, you've got 10 people showing up in a matter of a week or two weeks or three weeks.
Remember, one more time, you're a lot closer than you think you are.
You're a lot closer than you think you are.
I'm wrapping up.
And as I wrap up, I want you to understand this.
It's all great run by something called a punishment reward system.
I want to challenge everybody who's on this call, who is attentive, who is ready, who wants 2026 to be much better than 2025.
Put something on the line.
Put something on the line.
Say, if I hit EMD by March of this year, I'm going to take my family to Disneyland for three days.
But if I don't hit it, I'm going to punish myself by not taking a single trip until I hit EMD.
By the way, let me tell you, some of you might run for EMD and miss it.
I missed my EMD promotion twice.
Missing an EMD promotion does not mean you're not worthy of being an EMD.
It just means you were not ready at that time to be an EMD.
And you know what you do?
You come back and you run again.
Because odds are you had some type of momentum and you don't get discouraged.
You get encouraged to make sure you do it and you're doing stronger and better.
Because great artists are great comeback players.
And as I finish with that, as I finish, I just want to ask you a question.
Are you going to let your class graduate without you?
I believe over the next three months, we will promote more EMDs in GFI than we've promoted since the origination of our company.
I believe in the next 90 days, our company will promote over 100 organic EMDs.
Most of them are probably on this call right here, right now.
I just want to challenge you.
Be a leader of this class.
And don't let this class graduate without you.
Because why not you?
And why not now?
It's a new year.
It's a new chapter.
It's a new opportunity.
And you are going to be the next new EMD.
With that being said, it's time to get to work.
It's time to get to work.
Let's get after it.
I'm going to challenge you.
As Matthew Welsh comes back up, when this call ends, separate yourself from everybody else that's on this call.
Can you make 20 phone calls?
Can you book five appointments when this is done?
Because you know most people are going to log off at their computer.
And they're going to go back into doing whatever.
And they're going to take their rest of the Saturday off.
Well, what if you book five appointments?
What if you get ahead of everybody else and you begin to take some action?
I believe there's going to be some amazing leaders coming out of this call.
Matthew, thank you for hosting the call today.
So far, my brother, it's been one of the best calls I've been in a really long time.
And you're doing just unfreaking believable hosting it.
We couldn't have a better host.
So with that being said, guys, why not you?
Why not now?
You're a lot closer than you think you are.
Let's go get EMD.
Matthew Welsh, I'll pass the call right back to you, my brother.
Thank you so much.
My man, my man.
Mario, thank you so much, brother.
We appreciate you.
Guys, did you see how Mario's literally in the airport right now?
He's trying to board a plane.
And yeah, he figured out a way to be on the call today.
Let me ask you a question.
Are you willing to do what's required?
Are you willing to figure it out?
Everybody always wants to say, hey, this is the reason I did it.
This is the reason I didn't.
And leaders say, this is the reason I did.
I figured out a way.
It wasn't easy.
It wasn't perfect.
Everything didn't go smooth.
I just figured out a way.
Guys, there's not a lack of resources in this world.
There's a lack of resourcefulness.
And I want to challenge you to step into that resourcefulness and say, you know what?
I don't need everything around me to be perfect.
Well, I'm not successful because my EMD didn't teach me this.
Aren't you an entrepreneur?
Why are you waiting for your EMD to teach you things?
If you don't know how a product works, go read the brochure.
If you don't know how to direct recruit, go call people that know how to direct recruit.
If you don't know how to run the system, go figure that out.
If you, like nobody's teaching me how to close, then go study closing.
Invest in it.
Act like a real entrepreneur.
The moment you realize that nobody's coming to save you is the moment you will step up and
win a business.
The moment you take extreme ownership of your life and say, you know what?
If it's going to be, it's up to me.
Nobody's going to get me promoted.
Nobody's going to build my team for me.
Nobody's going to build my business for me.
Nobody's going to develop my mind for me.
Nobody's going to develop my skills for me.
Nobody's going to develop me as a leader for me.
I have to take responsibility and I have to go do it.
The faster you take on that ownership, the faster you win.
Everyone always wants to point the finger at everyone else.
Say, hey, I'm not an EMD because of my EMD.
No, you're not an EMD because you haven't done what's required.
Oh, I'm not an EMD because of this.
No, you're not an EMD because you haven't done what's required.
You just haven't figured it out yet.
And so I hate to be the guy that's brutally honest with you, but I got to be the guy that's brutally honest with you because if I don't wake you up, I don't know who will.
You are at where you are at in life because of the thoughts you think, the decisions you've made, and the actions you've taken, good or bad.
Your financial situation is because of the thoughts you think, the decisions you've made, and the actions you've taken.
Your current title, promotion, size of team, all of that is decided because of the thoughts you think, the decisions you've made, and the actions you've taken.
You want better results?
Take better actions, which comes from better decisions, which comes from thinking better.
If you want your business to improve, focus on improving yourself.
Can we make that commitment, guys?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
You know, Mario touched on something a second ago, and he was touching on some of the intangibles of taking your EMD promotion.
And I just wanted to pull this up so you guys can see it.
I think it's really, really important for you guys to see it.
When we're looking to promote an EMD, it's more than, oh, I just hit numbers.
It's more than I just hit some numbers.
This is the requirements.
If I'm promoting an EMD out of my base shop, these are the things that I'm paying attention to.
The EMD being promoted.
You ready?
The EMD being promoted.
They need to be able to get directs at any point in time.
At the drop of the dime, they need to be able to go get two, three, four directs.
They need to be doing 10 plus recruits a month outside of their executive exchange.
They need to be doing a minimum of 25,000 points per month outside of their executive exchange.
They need to have outside of their executive exchange.
They need to have five certified field trainers outside of their executive exchange.
They need to have an assistant.
Their team needs to look to them for leadership and not the EMD.
So if your team looks to your EMD for leadership and they don't look to you as the leader, that's not good.
Public speaking and training skills.
When you go out to EMD, you're going to be the one that's hosting every Zoom.
You're going to be the one doing announcements and recognition.
You're going to be the one training.
We got to develop our public speaking and training skills.
They know their business ratios and metrics.
Mario touched on those.
Levi touched on those.
You must trust their integrity.
Why is that important?
Because if I can't trust you to do the right thing, I'm not promoting you to EMD.
I'm not going to.
They are fully equipped to run their own base shop and they're 100% full time.
So every single one of you who's looking to be promoted, let me ask you a question.
If you were to go through this left column, the EMD being promoted, how many of these do you have outside of your executive exchange?
And now we do an audit.
Now we go to the right side, which is the executive exchange.
Your executive exchange should have the ability to get directs at any time.
They should be doing 10 plus recruits per month.
They should be doing 15 to 25,000 base shop points per month.
They should have 10 agents showing up to Zoom calls.
They should have three to five certified field trainers.
Their team should look to them for leadership and not you.
So let's say I'm promoting Juan to EMD.
If his team or the executive exchange team looks to Juan for guidance as the main person, then I'm not going to take this person as an exchange because the exchange is not leading the team.
So the exchange needs to be looked at as the leader.
Public speaking and training skills.
They just know their business ratios and metrics.
You must trust their integrity.
They're fully equipped and running their own team.
$50,000 watch or close to it.
Your executive exchange should be close to their $50,000 watch and or have it.
And you should have a strong relationship with them.
Meaning the EMD needs to have a strong relationship and they need to be full time.
So the left column is what you need to have outside of your executive exchange.
The right column is what your executive exchange needs to have.
So I want you to screenshot this.
And I want you to audit this.
And I want you to say, okay, there's the tangibles of becoming an EMD, which is the promotion requirements.
And then there's the intangibles of becoming an EMD, which are these numbers and these ratios and these metrics right here.
So now I want you to go solve for what you're missing.
Can we do that?
Yes, yes, yes.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
So a couple of things as we wrap up here today.
Okay.
We have a special contest going on right now.
A special contest going on where for those of you, you ready for this?
For those of you who go hit EMD within the first three months of this year, any of you that go hit EMD for the first three months of this year, qualify for golf score.
We're going to be taking the top 40 couples EMD only.
We're going to be taking you to San Diego, California for a top retreat.
It's a 90-day contest only.
You have to hit EMD within the first quarter of the year.
All the new organic EMDs that get promoted within the first quarter of the year, we're going to be doing a special retreat here in San Diego, an agency owner leadership academy where we train you.
We celebrate you for hitting your EMD promotion.
And we are going to equip you with everything that you need to go run a million point base shop, go grow your business, cross the half a million dollars.
So we are excited to see top 40 couples.
You have to hit EMD in the first quarter of this year.
And we are going to be taking you to San Diego, California.
So if you can commit to hitting EMD in the first quarter of this year, can you drop a one in the chat?
I want to see who's going to be coming to San Diego.
Who's going to be going to this leadership summit?
Who's going to be there?
You got to hit EMD in the first quarter of this year.
You got to hit EMD in the first quarter of this year.
What did Marty talk about?
Marty talked about taking ownership, operating like a real operator, growing, scaling, building, getting to the next level.
What did Megan talk about?
How to be a dominant EMD within your first year of being in business.
What did Leland talk about?
Leading from the front, having a strong personal example, keeping your direct strong, keeping your personal production strong.
That's what Leland talks about.
What did Yareev talk about?
Increasing your volume, thinking in a volume mindset.
I need more recruits.
I need more licensing.
I need to increase my volume, increase my phone call volume.
What did Levi talk about?
The metrics, the numbers, understanding them.
And what did Mario talk about?
Leading, stepping up as a leader, holding yourself accountable, becoming a person worth following, going and knocking out EMD within the first quarter.
However, this entire call was designed to meet with the next EMDs and say, okay, this is what we got to do.
I opened the call with this and I'm going to end the call with this.
The biggest gap in the world is the gap between knowing and doing.
Most people know what to do.
What people struggle with is execution.
Most people are addicted to learning, but they're allergic to execution.
Most people are addicted to learning, but they're allergic to execution.
I want to encourage you to not be a professional meeting attender.
Meaning you just show up to calls to learn.
It's time to execute.
Let's kind of go do something with the knowledge.
We lowered the production requirements from $150,000 to $100,000.
Can't get much more simple than that.
Let's go knock out EMD in the first quarter of this year.
Let's have more EMD promotions in the first quarter of this year than we've ever had before.
Let's have a whole bunch of you cross your $100,000 ring, $200,000, quarter million dollars.
And let's go blow this thing up and light this company on fire.
What do you guys think?
You guys think we can do that?
Awesome.
Awesome, awesome, awesome.
So hey, I love you guys.
I believe in you guys.
I have your back.
Let's go grow.
Let's go scale.
And let's go do something that's never been done before together.
We are making history in GFI.
You are a part of it.
And I love the fact that we get to do it together.
I believe in you.
You got this.
Let's go get it done.
Talk to you guys soon.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
