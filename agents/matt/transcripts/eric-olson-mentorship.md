Yes, this has been absolutely incredible.
Give us some other way.
The champions who stay to the end are the ones who are the next millionaires.
So give yourselves a hand.
Let's say hello to you.
Can we give it up for all of the Dream Team that helped with this event absolutely incredible?
Can we give it up to A.D.?
And can we give it up to you, Brady?
With a really loud stop.
Can we give it up to our YouTube audience?
Look at these faces.
You got it?
Please, guys, guys, listen.
It's serious.
I'm really surprised at this moment.
So I want to have our incredible CEO close us out.
And you guys know GFI would not be here without this show.
I mean, he just has a selfless heart.
He's loyal to the soil.
He just wants to see everyone win.
That's why he does it every single day.
So can we end strong, Tim Neverson?
Finish strong?
Finish strong!
Let's give a warm welcome to our CEO, Stan Malkin!
All right, let's go to the team.
Thank you, everybody.
Let's go to the team.
Thank you, everybody.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Thank you, everybody.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
Let's go to the team.
All right, Robert Terry.
Great interviewing.
All right.
How's everybody doing?
All right.
How's everybody doing?
By the way, who was thinking about all these billionaires on stage and you're like,
well, if that guy can do it, I can do it.
If that lady can do it, I can do it.
Anybody have that feeling?
Right?
Because all we owe you in GFI is we owe you a legitimate opportunity and examples of success.
And that's what we have here in GFI.
We owe you a legitimate opportunity and examples of success.
So I want everyone to get a blank sheet of paper out.
Everyone get a blank sheet of paper out.
I'm going to have you write this down.
Everyone get a blank sheet of paper out.
I'm going to have you write this down.
So in the spirit of who wants to be a millionaire, because I want every single one of you to be
a senior partner or you to be a senior partner of GFI.
And the way we think about it, you know, I used to play college football and, you know, they have what's called the NFL.
The NFL is the platform.
And then they have 32 teams in the NFL.
Right?
And so there's the Miami Dolphins.
There's the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
There's all these NFL teams.
So this is what I want you to think about.
GFI is the NFL.
GFI is the platform.
And there's going to be 32 teams, 32 senior partners.
Does that make sense?
So if you're going to be the CEO and founder of your own company, and you're going to partner with GFI as the platform, just like there's the 49ers and the Raiders and the Dolphins and the Buccaneers and all the different teams, you're going to have your team, your company, you're a senior partner, and you're going to partner with GFI.
Does that make sense?
Right?
And the first step to doing that is making a million dollars.
You got to go make a million dollars.
And we've had 20 people make a million dollars or 2 million or 3 million or 4 million or 5 million a year in our first two years.
20 plus people do it.
We have a 29 year old making 5 million.
We have a 35 year old making 4 million.
Right?
It's just incredible.
And some of you might not think that's a big deal.
There's other companies out there.
They've been in business 15 years and they got 2 millionaires.
After 15 years.
We have 20 millionaires in 20 months.
So we build leaders.
We build millionaires here.
So, some of you guys know my story.
I was 21 years old.
I started in the company.
My first year I did next to nothing.
I did almost nothing.
The reason why I did next to nothing is because I was still playing college football.
I was still working my job.
I was still coaching in sports.
I was doing all this other stuff.
So I wasn't serious.
And then I went to a big event.
Just like this.
They say big decisions are made at big events.
So then I went to a big event like this.
And I decided to go all in.
Because if you guys heard it.
If you want to be all in.
You got to be all in.
Right?
So I decided to go all in.
And I went and made a quarter million my first year full time.
Half a million my second year full time.
A million a year.
My third year full time.
And I was making a million a year.
Then I was making a million a month.
And my number one goal was to help others get to the next level.
And so you have a couple different options on how to do it.
So one option.
If you want to make a million dollars a year.
You help 10 people on your team make a hundred thousand.
If you help 10 people on your team make a hundred thousand a year.
You're making a million dollars a year.
That's exactly how you do it.
Okay?
And then from there.
You say I want to make a million a month.
I want to make an eight figure income.
Well you help 10 people on your team make a million a year.
And if you help 10 people on your team make a million a year.
You're making a million a month.
And that's exactly how I did it.
And if I can do it.
You can do it.
And you know what I love about our business?
We're genuinely helping clients.
We're doing the best thing for people.
They're getting high rates of return.
We're giving them guarantees on their money.
We're protecting their families.
Protecting their health.
Protecting their business.
Helping them save money.
Right?
We're giving them indexing strategies.
Locking in their gains.
Tax free retirement.
We're doing really good things for people.
Think about it.
Every other company is trying to make you spend your money.
And all we're trying to do is help you save your money.
It's a good thing.
We're doing good things for people.
So you should feel very, very good about what we're doing here at GFI.
We're not offering accessories.
We're offering necessities.
People actually need what we have.
So those are a couple different things you can do.
Right?
But let me tell you how I made my first million dollars a year at age 25.
Would you guys like to know it?
All right.
So here's how to do it.
I think it's very simple.
It's very simple.
Because I was just thinking about it.
We're going to come out of here today.
We're going to do a little recognition.
We have Greg Cap closing us out.
And then we're done.
We're going to do a little bit of a plan.
But I really want you to take action coming out of here.
There's only seven days left of the month.
We want you to go out there and finish the month strong.
Have a great February.
So I'm going to give you this plan.
And I haven't talked about this plan in like three years.
But this is the exact plan on how I made a million bucks a year.
So here we go.
You ready?
It's called the three by three by three by three plan.
Three by three by three by three plan.
And I live on the West Coast.
So we're not talking about In-N-Out Burger.
Three by three by three by three.
We're talking about this plan.
This is exactly how I made a million dollars a year when I was 25 years old.
And by the way, we get paid double now in GFI than what we did back then.
So three by three by three.
So I want you to write that down.
Three by three by three by three plan.
And then I want you to draw a big circle at the top of the page and put your name.
Okay?
So stay with me.
Put a big circle.
Put your name.
All right?
So Kevin and Melissa.
They write their name down.
Both.
And then I want you to draw three circles.
The first three of the three by three by three plan is you go recruit three personal direct new business partners.
By the way, let me challenge you.
Stop waiting for your team to do it.
You go do it.
The best kind of a leader is a do it first leader.
I want you to know that.
The best kind of a leader is a do it first leader.
I'm recruiting direct to the company right now, just so you guys know.
So we're doing the same thing together.
So you draw a big circle you and then you draw three circles because you're going to go recruit three directs, three personal direct business partners in GFI.
Okay?
Are you with me so far?
That's the first three.
The second three, the speed of the leader determines the speed of the pack.
So your team does what you do.
You can't expect others to do it if you're not going to do it.
So you go get your three and then guess what?
You can then challenge your three to then get three.
So draw your little diagram.
Draw your little bubble chart.
Here's you, big circle, right?
Your name, your three personal directs, your three direct business partners.
You want to hear something funny?
You want to hear something crazy?
The three people I wrote down 23 years ago are still in business with me today.
23 years ago.
Because when you treat people good, they stick with you.
Marty Schaefer, he said, why don't you talk about that more?
I said, what do you mean?
Because I did the circle chart.
I have 51 people in my life that I've known for 20 or 30 or 35 years that are all still in business with me today.
Pretty cool.
Because relationships equal wealth.
And if you treat people good, they'll stick with you.
Remember, Tamar just said loyalty is everything, right?
And that's what it's all about.
So God willing, I hope we're all in business together in the next 30 years.
And then one day our kids will be in business together and our grandkids will be in business together.
Pretty awesome.
So the three by three by three plan.
You get three personal direct business partners.
Those three each get three.
So if you get three and they get three, how many do you now have on your team?
Twelve.
You have 12 business partners on your team.
You get three and they get three.
What if one of those 12 people on your team that you recruited in one month was a guy like Randy Cikaitis?
What if one of those guys on your team was a guy like Nate Iretton?
What if one of those guys on your team was like an Eric Carter?
What if one of those ladies on your team was a lady named Zena?
What if one of those guys on your team was a guy named Michael Chernowski?
You know that you're one person away from an explosion?
You're one person away from an explosion.
With quantity comes quality.
So you get three new business partners direct to you.
Those three get three.
You now have 12 on your team.
By the way, they say width equals wealth and depth equals stability.
So in your team, in your company, in your business, do you want width and wealth?
Or do you want depth and stability?
How about both?
So that's why you got to go wide and you got to go deep.
Right?
You got to do both.
Okay?
We're bringing up a guy here in a minute and he's the king of what we call tap rooting.
Tap rooting where you drive legs deep.
Right?
So you got to do both.
So first three is you recruit three personal directs.
The second three is those three get three.
Okay?
You with me so far?
You have 12 on your team.
By the way, out of those 12, some will, some will, so what?
Who's next?
But here's the truth.
Enough will.
Enough will.
Out of the 12, not all 12 are going to be superstars, but two or three or four of them
are.
Two or three or four of them are and those become lifelong friends and business partners
and everybody does big things together, which is pretty exciting.
All right.
So that's the second three.
The third three, stay with me.
The third three, you average three sales per recruit.
You average three sales per recruit.
We have a special going on right now.
If you do your three, three 30, three recruits and three sales in 30 days, you'll go all the
way up to a 50% contract.
Back in my day, when I started, we were at a 25% contract.
Now, all you got to do is three, three 30.
You're at a 50% contract, which is pretty awesome.
I want to challenge everybody to get their three, three 30 by the end of the month, worst
case scenario.
So everybody that joins the business, they need to be doing three recruits and three
sales anyway.
So they get their promotion.
So three sales per recruit is totally doable.
Okay.
And we're going to go to the last three.
Let's recap.
First three is you recruit three personal threats.
The second three is those three each get three.
And then the third three is you have three sales per recruit.
Are you with me so far?
All right.
The last one, the fourth three, because this is the three by three by three by three plan.
The last three, number four is you average 3000 points per sale.
You average 3000 points per sale minimum, which is $250 in premium.
It doesn't matter if it's an IUL or a term or a whole life or it doesn't matter the product,
whatever's best for the client is what we want to do.
But $250 a month in premium times 12 months in a year equals what?
3000, 3000 target points.
Okay.
And points are what you get based off of your promotions.
Okay.
So the fourth three is 3000 points per sale.
Some sales are going to be way bigger than $250.
Some sales might be smaller, but regardless, the average sales $250, which in my opinion
is very, very low because Levi's average sales 2000 a month, right?
Some people's average sales 500 a month.
Some people are doing a lot of rollovers, but that's a bigger deal.
So this is all these numbers are very conservative, right?
Some people say, what do you mean three?
I was thinking 30.
What are you talking about 3000 points?
I was thinking 10,000 points, right?
Okay.
So we're being very conservative.
All right.
Now trick question, trick question.
You ready?
Stay with me.
How many points should you be averaging per recruit based on these numbers?
3000?
Wrong.
9,000.
That is correct.
9,000.
Why is it 9,000?
Because it's three sales per recruit and it's 3000 points per sale.
So 3000 points per sale times three recruits equals 9,000 points per recruit.
Okay.
You with me so far?
All right.
So let's recap three by three by three by three plan.
You get three personal recruits.
Those three get three.
You now got 12 on your team.
You average three sales per recruit.
You average 3000 points per sale, which is now 9,000 points per recruit.
You guys good so far?
All right.
So you now recruited 12 people on your team in one month.
And there's some of you like, that's too small.
That's way too small.
We have people recruiting 500 people a month, a thousand people a month in our organization.
We have some people like Efren thinking way bigger than that, right?
Which I love.
And so, so here's an example, 12 recruits per month on your team times 9,000 points per recruit.
What's 12 times 9,000?
108,000 points.
108,000 points.
108,000 points.
How many points do you need for EMD?
About 100,000.
Okay.
So now you're at 100,000 points.
So now you're at the top contract.
And you're at the top contract.
And you're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
You're at the top contract.
Now that you're in EMB.
108,000 points times 85% equals 92,000.
That's a pretty good income for the year, right?
92,000 for the year.
That's not a bad job.
But this is 92,000 for the month.
This is for the month.
I was doing this at age 25.
You get three and they get three.
Not that hard.
I'm just saying.
It's not that hard.
We now have better companies.
We now have better products.
We now have better compensation.
We now have ownership.
We now have the upside.
All it is is you get three and they get three.
You're now making $92,000 a month and you're now making 1.1 million a year.
Into your life.
Into your life.
$92,000 a month and 1.1 million a year.
By the way, my last 40 speeches of the 40-city tour, I was very CEO-like.
Vision, mission, system, true city, home office executives.
But I was like, you know, this is the last city tour.
I need some more money wins.
I need some more money wins.
I need some more money wins.
I need some more money wins.
I need to challenge these people.
This is for all of us.
Let's take action.
Why?
And so I'm just going to tell you how I get it.
I'm just going to tell you how I get it.
Three by three by three.
It sounds simple.
It sounds simple.
It's not that hard to do.
You get three.
They get three.
Three sales per recruit.
3,000 points per sale.
You're making $92,000 a month.
You're making 1.1 million a year on a 1099.
And that is real.
That is real.
By the way, when I first started, I was like you.
I was, I'm sorry, not like you, but I'll get like some people who left.
I was young, single, broke, skeptical, negative, right?
I was like, I don't know how to recruit.
I don't know how to sell.
I'm shy.
I'm introverted.
I don't know about this business.
I don't know about finance.
All I know is football.
And then a guy stood up there and goes, here's how you make a million dollars a year.
Here's how you make $92,000 a month.
You get three and they get three.
And I was like, what?
I'm making $30,000 a year at the airport.
You need to tell me I can make $30,000 a week?
And we're helping people?
And we're doing the best thing for people?
And it's legal?
And people need this stuff?
What?
I can turn my annual income into my weekly income?
I need to figure this out.
I need to figure this out.
I need to get on the farm.
By the way, they say an introvert and a shy person is only that way until they find their passion.
Until they find their passion.
Until they find their passion.
What if everything in your life has prepared you for this moment right here?
That's what I believe.
That's what I believe.
So that's the three by three by three by three plan.
Be honest, be real.
Who feels like that's maybe a little easier than I thought?
That's not that hard.
Turn to your neighbor and say, even you can do that.
Three by three.
Even you.
Even you.
Even you.
Even you.
Alright.
Hey, that needs to be your new action plan.
That needs to be your new goals.
By the way, I don't have goals.
I have a to-do list.
Don't have goals.
Have a to-do list.
Right?
Don't have goals.
Have commitments.
You gotta have commitments over your goals.
By the way, I don't have a lot of strengths.
And I'm definitely not perfect.
I have a lot of weaknesses.
But something I'm good at is if I say something, I'm gonna do it.
Period.
I'm gonna sell a big dream and I'm gonna deliver on the dream that I sell.
So this 30-30-30 thing is real.
I just want you to know this 30-30-30 thing is real.
And we're gonna go make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we'll pay you 46 grand next month.
You make 46 keys.
And that's okay.
That's a good start.
Right?
So you're gonna make it happen.
And you're gonna make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to make it happen.
And we want you to be a part of it.
You can do three who get three.
So the next seven days, go get your three.
And you only do half.
Or we'll pay you 46 grand next month.
You make 46 keys.
And that's okay.
That's a good start.
Right?
So this is what I'm talking about.
You're in the highest paid industry in the world.
With the fastest phone company in the world.
Make the best time ever to do this business.
And everybody's retiring.
Everybody needs our help.
The time is down.
The time is down for every single one of you.
So what I pride myself in is we build one percent of people.
We build one percenters in GFI.
We build leaders in GFI.
We attract the best of the best of the best here at GFI.
You know what people tell me?
Hey, you guys are stacked with leadership.
I'll say, that's right.
We got the best of the best of the best.
We're just waiting for you to step up as a leader.
We're looking for one percenters.
To become a one percenter, you've got to make a half a million dollars a year or more.
Right?
In GFI, you become a one percenter.
We give you a one percenter hat.
You're invited to one percenter meetings.
You're a part of our advisory council.
You're helping make decisions for the entire company.
It's a big deal.
In 2026, we want you to become a one percenter.
We believe you can do it.
How do you become a one percenter?
You look at what the 99% of the world does and you do the exact opposite.
That's how you become a one percenter.
The other way you become a one percenter is you focus on helping the other 99%.
If you go help the other 99%, you become a one percenter.
Last thing I'm going to say, you chose to be an entrepreneur.
Congratulations.
You're an entrepreneur.
You're self-employed.
You're a business owner.
You're an independent contractor.
You're on a 1099.
This is the path you chose.
Congratulations.
One of the best decisions you'll ever make.
But let me just tell you, this is not easy.
This is not easy.
Okay?
But you are different by design.
You notice that your brothers and sisters, they're not going to be entrepreneurs.
They're going to be, they're going to have their little jobs.
That's okay.
They're different.
You're built different.
Right?
My parents, they're great people.
They're employees.
Brothers and sisters, great people.
They're employees.
You're the chosen one.
You're the bloodline breaker.
You're the generational peak person.
You're going to change your last day forever.
You've got to understand that.
Right?
So, so we put that, we put something different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
You're going to be different.
Right?
So, so we put that, because you're the different one, because you're the weird one, because
you're the one that thinks outside the box, guess what?
Weird and worse or broken and cool.
Right?
Simple as hell.
Simple as hell.
You know what's interesting to me?
Is you'll run up to me and go, hey, hey, I don't know you.
Can I take a picture?
I know you have a billion dollar company.
Can I ask you four questions?
And it falls out.
How come you can't do that in the real world?
You have no problem doing that to me.
You've run up to me.
No problem.
But you're afraid of all these other people?
It doesn't make any sense.
You kidding me?
I'm glad you do that.
I'll take a picture.
I love it.
I think it's awesome.
But you don't do that in the real world with the people that actually need your help.
Make sense?
We're helping people.
Right?
You have two options.
H-O-H or S-O-S.
H-O-H is the honor of helping.
I have the honor of helping people.
Or S-O-S, the shame of selling.
We're not selling anything.
We're helping.
The honor of helping.
If you know that you're helping people, you'll talk to everybody.
You'll talk to everybody.
That's what we need to do.
So last thing I'll say, because when I was like you, not like you, but the person that
left, my first year, I did nothing.
You know why?
I thought I was too cool for school.
I'm a college football player.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
These people are weird.
And then when I noticed, they were weird and rich and I was broken core.
And I was working in the toll booth.
Thought I was cool.
And I said, you know what?
I'm going to stop caring what people think about me.
What people think about me is none of my business.
I'm going to go talk to people.
I'm going to call them.
I'm going to knock on the door.
I'm going to get after them.
I'm going to make it happen.
I'm going to do it.
And all of a sudden, three years later, I was making a million bucks a year.
You could do the exact same thing.
This is the one percenter company.
If you want to change your life and all five Fs and have true fulfillment and become
a one percenter, that's GFI.
That's exactly where you're going to be.
So you've got to become the best version of yourself.
Let me ask you a question.

I wish I could ask them all, who's Marcel Macias?
There's so many more 1%ers, but I know a lot of the other 21%ers and above have already
spoke today.
So I'm just so proud of all of you.
By the way, did you notice that we're multicultural in GFI?
Isn't that awesome?
Isn't that incredible?
I'm so proud of that.
It's amazing.
All right.
So someone mentioned it earlier.
By the way, I appreciate my cousin herself and giving my daughter a shout out.
Her birthday, that's so nice.
Lovely cousins.
Appreciate you guys.
All right.
So here's the deal.
We have a special going on.
I know someone mentioned it.
It's called the $500 Fast Start Bonus.
You guys heard that?
Yeah.
We have a special going on and there's five things you got to do in order to hit that
$500.
We're going to give you a $500 bonus from GFI.
There's five things you got to do.
What are the five things?
Number one, you got to fill out your ICA.
All right.
Get your membership agreement done.
That's number one.
Number two, do your digital PR, digital personal financial review on TEP.
All right.
That's number two.
Number three, you got to love.
Get your license.
Pass your life test.
You guys here, they just made the life test even easier.
We don't have to do the course, the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course
and the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course,
the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course,
the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course,
the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course,
the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course, the 30 hours of the course,
get your license, pass your life test.
You guys here, they just made the life test even easier.
We don't have to do the course, the 30 hour course anymore.
That's huge.
That's number three, get your license.
What's number four?
On boarding.
Number four is three, three thirty.
Three recruits and three sales.
You got to get you a three, three thirty.
That's number four.
And number five, not license.
What does net license mean?
Make the first thousand bucks.
Make the first thousand bucks.
This is what you're supposed to do already, but we're going to allow you to do it
and get a $500 bonus starting in January.
So that's a huge deal.
By the way, we recruited 57,000 people in GFI in two years,
and none of them got that $500 bonus.
So the next 50,000 people, all of them are going to get the $500 bonus
and they just follow our system.
And what does system stand for?
Save yourself time, energy, and money.
Follow the system.
It works.
Pretty incredible.
So, so to give you an example of this is not that hard.
You can do it.
If anybody did those five things in the last six months, I want you to run up here.
I want you to grab a hat.
You can grab a hat.
They not like us.
Because they not.
They not like us.
Right?
So let's play that song, they not like us.

So let's play that song, they not like us.
And then also we have a special Orlando GFI hat.
So if you did those five things in the last six months, run it up here.
Bring your smiles.
Big deal.
Let's get the music going.
They not like us.
Congratulations.
Big deal.
Let's clap for the soccer club.
