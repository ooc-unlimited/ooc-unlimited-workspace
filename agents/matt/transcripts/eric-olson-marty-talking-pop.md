All right, T-File, come on.
Come on, T-File.
Come on.
Thank you.
All right, how's everybody doing?
Right.
Hey, great to be here with all of you.
Super excited.
It's been an awesome day so far, and I've been sitting in the back very, very impressed
with all the incredible speakers and great leaders.
You guys have a deep bench of leaders here.
I'm very proud of all of you guys.
So it's an honor and a privilege to be here.
I want to start with a question.
What if everything you've done in your life has prepared you for this moment right here?
All the crap, all the BS, all the good stuff, all the great stuff, and all the bad stuff
has prepared you for this moment right here.
You know, I believe that, and I want you to believe that as well because it's true.
You guys remember two years ago when GFI started, we said we were going to do this.
We were going to do this.
We were going to do this.
We were going to do this.
Guess what?
We're doing everything we talked about.
Every single thing we talked about, we're actually doing it.
Right?
You know, I have a lot of great mentors and advisors and people that I respect in the industry.
They're like, do you know the whole industry is talking about GFI?
Do you guys know how Alok decided to go full-time as the CTO of GFI?
He went to a New York conference on insurance and technology, and one of the main companies
that people were talking about was GFI.
And GFI wasn't there.
Right?
It was crazy.
He's like, oh my gosh.
Right?
So I just want you guys to know we are doing what we said we're going to do, but we're
just getting started, and the best is yet to come.
You guys know some of the stats?
57,000 new associates, a billion in annuities last year, a hundred billion in life premium
last year, paying out almost $200 million to the field last year in our second year.
We started from zero.
You guys realize that?
Like, I looked at Randy's numbers.
You guys don't want to look.
Hold it up.
You saw Randy's numbers?
Randy started at zero two years ago, and he's paid $21 million to his team his first two
years from zero.
$21 million.
That's what we do.
Right?
So I'm not good at a lot of things, but what I am good at is if we're going to say something,
we're going to do it.
Simple as that.
So I'm very excited about what's happening.
Today's a special day because I brought my wife, Sandra, with me.
So where's she at?
There she is, honey.
I appreciate her.
And she's an incredible speaker, so I'm going to have her speak one of these times.
But I appreciate her.
And think about, people know how crazy I am, but think about how crazy she is.
Imagine this conversation.
I know I worked my ass off for almost a quarter century to build what we got.
We're making a million a month, and we're doing great.
But let's start all over and leave everything and start from scratch.
And she's like, I believe you.
Let's do this.
Think about that.
Right?
Isn't that crazy?
Right?
And literally, now, the truth is, because I'm always very transparent, the truth is,
this is a hundred times harder than I thought it was going to be.
Right?
And my dad told me that.
He goes, why do you think I never did this?
This is a hundred times harder than I ever think it's going to be.
Right?
And he was right.
So it is.
Right?
However, it's also a hundred times more worth it than I thought it was going to be as well.
Right?
Which is awesome.
So I definitely appreciate my wife for believing in me, believing in us, and what we're doing here.
This is not our company.
This is our company.
Just so you guys know.
Right?
That's why we created it.
That's why we have it.
For partners.
We want you to be a senior partner in GFI.
Someone just told me, he goes, you're pretty smart.
I said, what do you mean?
He said, the fact that he brought on Alok to build Teva, and he has 12 developers and engineers building Teva,
and now he's a part of the POP program, so we can get our 30 times multiple, and if he's a part of it,
he's like, I was like, yeah, I'm a little smarter than you thought.
Right?
Like, and by the way, Alok is really good.
Right?
He's really good.
I'm so proud of him.
But he's a part of the POP program.
Marty's a part of the POP program.
Our C-level executives are a part of the POP program.
A lot of you guys are a part of the POP program.
This is real.
Right?
We're going to be a $30 billion company in five years.
Right?
By 2030.
30, 30, 30.
Our vision.
By 2030, we'll be a $30 billion company, and we're going to get it 30 times multiple.
So my thing is, let's get 1% better every day.
Every single one of you get 1% better every day.
And if you get 1% better every day, and in 100 days, you'll be 100% better.
So just make that goal.
By the way, compete with your best.
Just do that.
Just compete with your best.
You don't have to worry about the rest.
Just compete with your personal best.
And if you really, really were 100% honest with yourself, don't you feel like you got more
in you?
Right?
You know you got more in you.
100% you got more in you.
So just compete with the best version of yourself.
You know, there's a lady named Cody Sanchez, and she does some stuff on Instagram.
And she's a sharp businesswoman.
And Austin Harwood posted something about her the other day.
It was pretty good.
She said, you know how everyone says, here's the top 100 ways to be successful.
She goes, there's really one.
She goes, I've interviewed all the millionaires.
There's one.
Obsession.
There's one thing.
Obsession.
And if you want to know what I got, it's obsession.
That's my wife.
Right?
It's real.
It's not kidding.
Right?
And the obsession comes from delivering on the dream that I sold.
That's where it comes from.
I sold you guys the dream, and I want to deliver on the dream that I sold.
And it's going to happen.
And that's why I'm obsessed.
So if you're going to be obsessed with something, be obsessed with becoming the best version of
yourself, be obsessed with getting 1% better every day, be obsessed with getting to your
next level.
Right?
That's all I would recommend.
Just be obsessed with getting to that next level every single day.
And then that's what actually gets you to that next level.
So obsessions become your possessions.
Right?
And whatever you're obsessed on is what you'll get.
And so I just want to challenge you to have a healthy obsession to become successful.
You know, I love the great leaders in this room.
We've got some MLC members.
You know what MLC is?
Millionaire Leadership Council.
The great Paul Hart.
The great Randy Sikaitos.
The great Dewan and Kate from Cofield.
They're a part of what's called the MLC.
Right?
The Millionaire Leadership Council.
And you don't have to be first.
You've got to be next.
Right?
We have 18 millionaires in GFI, which is pretty awesome.
By the way, Ali and Asana, they came in from Canada.
They're like this close to being a part of that next Millionaire Leadership Council.
Right?
Which is awesome.
And they're about 800 right now.
So that's pretty awesome.
But we train the next millionaires.
By the way, Marty and I, we always talk about feedback is a gift.
Because we know we will be number one in the industry.
But we also know we won't be number one in the industry by ourselves.
It takes a team.
I played on sports teams my whole life.
I coach sports teams my whole life.
And so team is together.
Everyone achieves more.
That's why I want you to give us feedback.
And feedback is a gift.
But part of our culture in GFI is called hug, jab, hug.
It's called bun, meet, bun.
It's called soft, hard, soft.
Right?
Because there's about 200 things that you could be excited about in GFI.
200 good things about GFI.
And there's always one or two things we need to get better on.
I want you to know that it's always in Marty and I's mind is how we get better, how we get better, how we get better.
So we just formed something called the Advisory Councils.
And we have the top, top, we have a board of board of directors.
By the way, there's a bunch of billionaires with a B who are now trying to be a part of the board of directors.
Just so you guys know.
Like real, real, real legit billionaires.
Like how do I become a part of the board?
So we're forming that board.
We're probably not even going to launch it until this summer or 2027.
That will be the board of directors.
Then we have our field board.
You've got to get 2 million above or more even to be considered.
And we have the home office board as well, the home office C-level executives.
Right?
Which is awesome.
By the way, all of our home office C-level executives are part of the POP program.
Right?
Which is pretty incredible.
So they're all in with us.
I feel sorry, no offense, but I feel sorry for some of my old Pinnacle staff who were like, didn't want to come to GFI.
They could have been C-level executives are part of the POP program right now.
Right?
But I love them for being in Pinnacle.
But anyways, that was a mistake on their part.
So anyways, but these C-level executives that are now in GFI are part of the POP program.
It's a huge deal.
So that's our home office executive board.
And then after that, we have our Millionaire Leadership Council board.
And then after that, we have our one percenter board, which is 500,000 and above.
We did a meeting last Friday with them, with the GFI Advisory Council, 500 and 999.
And then today, we did one with the 250 to the 499.
49999 is called the GFI Advisory Council.
So the last one for the one percenters, half a million or more.
Today, we call them the two percenters.
Right?
Because they're between 250, 250, and 500.
So the point is, we have all these amazing boards, and we're wanting feedback.
We say feedback is a gift.
We want to do this together because we're going to go become number one in the industry.
And it's pretty awesome that we actually value that, and we love that because I was making
a million a month doing 300 million a year, and they didn't want any feedback.
Zero.
And even if I gave it, they didn't want it.
Right?
And so here, we actually allow you to give feedback, which is pretty incredible.
So my point of all that is, I want you to fight to be a part of these advisory councils.
Fight to be a part of these boards.
It's a pretty awesome thing.
You know that your circle is everything.
Your associations are everything.
It's a huge, huge deal.
And so, by the way, think about this, that after 40 years in the practice company, they never
went international.
We did it in our first year.
Right?
Think about that.
Right?
And after 40 years in the practice company, they never built their own tech platform.
We did it in our second year.
Right?
It's just pretty crazy.
So I want you to know that as you increase your capacity, you'll increase your income.
You guys know that?
As you increase your capacity, you'll increase your income.
And think about this.
GFI started GFI US.
Then we started GFI Canada.
Then we started GFI International.
Thanks to the great Marcel and Issa Macias back there.
I appreciate you guys who are directors of international expansion over there.
So then we started that.
Then we just started GFI Puerto Rico.
It's officially live.
And then we started Tepa Technologies.
Then we started GFI Columbia, which is another company.
Right?
So we have six different companies just right there running all at the exact same time.
Oh, by the way, we had a baby in the process.
Right?
He's now five months old.
Oh, by the way, we're paying $500,000 to a million a month in lawsuits right now.
You're welcome.
Right?
And right now, every month, $500,000 to a million a month in lawsuits still.
Right?
For you.
And paying you 30% more on life business.
And paying you 50% more on the living business.
Just so you guys know.
Pretty crazy.
Right?
We could have said, wait until the lawsuits are over or we won't pay you more.
No, we're paying you more now.
Right?
Pretty crazy.
Right?
Pretty crazy.
And so all of that at the same time.
So I'm back there fighting battles.
Right?
Boom, boom, boom.
Like, it's all good.
Luckily, I'm from the east side of San Jose.
Luckily, luckily, luckily, I'm not worried.
Luckily, I have no fear.
Right?
Whatsoever.
Luckily.
Right?
And I know for a fact we're going to be number one in the industry because I know what I just did the last two years.
I know what we just did the last two years.
And I know what it takes.
Right?
I know what we're doing.
Does that make sense?
I'm not kidding.
This is on my kids.
I am 10 trillion percent more confident about us being number one than I ever have in my life.
You know why?
Because I know what I've used to do last two years.
I've heard it for sure.
And I know, honey, I told you I'm a happy speaker.
Is that true statement?
Yes or yes?
Like what I just said.
And why?
By the way, this man, he just said, he heard him say that he's having a sense.
I have said this before.
I thought he was a sense before.
No.
That's not even close.
The man does not play here.
He does not.
Like the 12 hours a day with the one thing.
I was like, I wish.
That was typical.
It's now 20 hours a day.
I'm not kidding.
He's in the middle of sleeping until he wakes up.
Like nap in between.
Wake up and he's on his belt.
And then he'll take another nap and wake up at the top of the night and look at his belt.
Everybody say, thanks, guys.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's like a real obsession.
And reality of why he's so obsessed with his diet.
I mean, he's my husband.
I can have these conversations with the night.
I can have those behind the scenes.
And I'm like, why are you doing this?
Like, why?
It's the point where I get to the work.
I'm like, you need to rest.
Like, there's a point where you need to allow your body to rest.
And he said, I get a promise.
And I get a promise that I'm going to deliver on it.
I'm going to deliver on it.

Matt Wells is 29 years old making 500 bucks a year.
Two years ago he was making 1.4.
Like what?
By the way, do you know what I told Matt Wells?
And this is an EMU meeting.
Tomorrow's going to be a lot different clock.
What I told Matt Wells, I said the first three, four,
five months no one could know who I am and see my face.
I said, Matt, you need to be Eric Golson.
I said, I got one thing you need to do.
Just one.
He's like, I'm going to be Eric Golson.
I'm going to be Eric Golson.
I said, one thing.
Ready?
I need a PhD in selling the dream.
I need you to get a PhD in selling the dream.
I'm going to give you guys some advice.
You need to get a PhD in selling the dream.
PhD in selling the dream.
Some of you got a PhD in negativity.
Some of you got a PhD in complaining.
Some of you got a PhD about thinking about your past.
By the way, the past is the past.
You can't change it.
You can't change it.

The only thing you can think about.
That's why my song is the best is yet to come.
That's all you have to think about.
The best is yet to come.
The best is yet to come.
If I already gave you some advice, get a PhD in selling the dream.
Get a PhD in selling the dream.
You throw it out there, it's going to come back to you.
It's called a boomerang.
It could happen.
It will happen.
And Matthew Wells did that.
And now he's the number one earner in the company.
Making $5 million a year.
There's a reason.
Success leaves loose.
Here's what I would tell you.
One of my mentors who I listen on YouTube every day, became a billionaire.
His name is Art Williams.
He said most people can't stay positive for 24 hours or more.
Most people literally can't do it for 24 hours.
I want to challenge you.
Stay positive.
Stay excited.
Stay fired up.
No matter what.
And get a PhD in selling the dream.
Get a PhD in selling the dream.
GFI is the best.
We will be the best.
Right?
By the way, do you know that like I was having this conversation with Mario and Lisa Bailey.
He's like 30 billion?
He's like, wait, how the heck can we be 30 billion?
I said, Mario, we did 100 million our first year, 200 million our second year.
We'll do 400 million this year.
We'll do 800 million the year after that.
We'll probably get a billion by 2028 and times the 30 times multiple.
That's 30 billion.
He's like, oh, you do one times 30?
That's how you do it?
I said, yes.
He's like, oh, that's super easy.
I said, yes.
He's like, oh, I thought you had to do 30 billion a year.
I said, no.
The technology multiple of 10 technologies, one times 30 is 30 billion.
He's like, oh, man, that's easy.
I said, yeah.
No doubt.
Like literally, we'll probably do it by 2028.
Just so you know.
Probably not before 2028.
Just so you guys know.
Some people are now telling me you're thinking too small.
Right?
30 billion?
It was way bigger than that.
So guess what?

Thinking bigger and believing faster.
So we do a lot of appointments with a lot of leaders.
A lot of people, all they talk is compensation, compensation, compensation, right?
Which is great.
But then they don't really have any calls.

So, another thing I want to say is, you know, the progressions of leadership.
You guys have heard of this before.
There's three progressions of leadership.
First, you've got to lead yourself.
Then you've got to lead others.
And then you've got to lead leaders.
But the most profitable part of our business is leading leaders.
You've got to be able to deal with different personalities.
You've got to be able to deal with some crazy people sometimes.
It's just part of the deal, right?
It's just part of the deal.
But guess what?
We're all children of God.
And so you've got to respect people.
But just know everybody's different.
Right?
But you've got to be able to deal with everybody.
And so leading leaders is the most profitable thing you can do.
Okay?
The next thing.
If you want to become a one percenter, make a half a million to 900, you've got to master
closing skills and people skills.
Try to write this down.
Right?
So the progressions of leadership and now the progressions of income.
Progressions of leadership is lead yourself, lead others, and then lead leaders.
Now let's talk about the progressions of income.
If you want to make between 500 grand and 999, you've got to master closing skills and master
people skills.
If you want to make a million to 10 million, you've got to master leadership development.
Building and developing leaders, that's how we developed 104 direct EMBs.
You've got to master the art of leadership development.
And then if you want to make eight figures or more, you've got to master the business ratios.
And that's why I'm so excited about Teva because that Teva dashboard right there shows all your ratios.
Shows all your ratios.
And so you guys know there's like 12 different business ratios of GFI.
Your recruit to client ratio.
Your recruit to license ratio.
Your license to net license ratios.
Your persistence ratios.
Right?
When people say, how do you go from a million a year in your 20s to a million a month in your 30s?
One answer.
The business ratios.
The business ratios.
The business ratios.
The business metrics.
Inspect what you expect.
When performance is measured, performance is improved.
You've got to track it and attack it.
Here's what I'd recommend.
You've got to think about it this way.
So we're going to close with the POP program here.
And I'm going to have Marty and I'm going to have Randy come up here.
Marty and Randy come up here.
And we'll talk about the POP program.
But with the POP program, you've got to be looking at your ratios.
Right?
You've got to be looking at your ratios and really understanding it.
And what's it all about?
Partnership ownership program.
I love that we're talking about non-stocks in a POP.
Right?
You're on the same page.
Right?
So there's all these different ratios.
But the number one way we went from a million a year to a million a month is the business
ratios.
So you've got to be tracking these business ratios.
So you're going to become a senior partner at GFI.
By the way, we're going to go to New York four to five times a year.
And we're going to have you sign your ownership with GFI.
Level two, level one, level three ownership of GFI.
We're going to New York in 10 days.
Who's going with us?
So in 10 days?
A couple of you.
Right?
We have the signings where you sign your POP program.
It's a real thing.
It's pretty awesome.
And so you're going to have your own company.
Right?
We have Matt Wells and Mario Baylor and Levi Boney and Uri Vazilay and their wives.
All of them.
By the way, you and your spouse are both on the legal contract.
It's a hundred pages.
It's a hundred pages.
Legal documents.
Right?
All the attorneys put it together.
Cost $500,000 to do it.
Took five years of thinking about it and vision to put it together.
It's a real thing.
It's the first time it's ever been done before.
It's a pretty awesome thing.
It's a real thing.

It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.

It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing.
You've got to make sure you understand that.
You're going to be a senior partner.
You're going to have your own company.
And you're going to partner with GFI.
And GFI is a different platform.
So let me put it this way.
You've got to wear two hats.
You've got to wear your founder's hat and your CEO's hat.
Your founder hat and your CEO hat.
The founder, you as the founder, you need to master selling the dream.
You need to master inspirational marketing.
You need to master the 5s and fulfillment formula.
You need to master building relationships with people.
Right?
The founder's hat is selling the dream.
But the CEO hat, the CEO hat is the business ratios.
It's the business metrics.
It's inspecting what you expect.
It's managing your goals.
It's managing your staff.
It's making sure you're treating this like a business.
Because then it will pay you like a business.
So there's two different hats.
The best case scenario, like let's say there's a husband and a wife or significant others.
One of you is the founder, master of the art of selling the dream.
And one of you is the CEO and your master of the ratios.
That would be an ideal situation.
If not, maybe you've got to do both.
But I put on one hat half the day and I put on the other hat the other half the day.
Make sense?
Your CEO hat and your founder's hat.
You got it?
I'd highly recommend that.
Your CEO hat and your founder's hat.
And then you partner with GFI.
Okay?
You partner with GFI.
So we are the first ever company to do this POP program.
How come it's never been done before?
I won't say it.
I'll let you say it.
How come it's never been done before?
Free.
Free.
Right?
I asked my wife.
Is she still here?
She left?
Right?
But so here's, that's why I had to get her while she was here.
Right?
But basically, when this became live, Marty's going to come up here.
When this became live, and like it got a little emotional for me because it was all done,
done, done, and done.
Because a couple years ago, someone said, give me the contract.
Give me the proof.
Give me the legal documents.
And I said, it's all in my head.
I just got it.
But I got to put it on paper and I got to have the smarter people that need to do it.
Right?
And sure enough, it took about a year to put everything together and all the stuff.
And finally, it was done.
And Marty called me.
He's like, it's done.
We did it.
It's done.
It's legal.
It can't be changed.
It's done.
And I got to go.
I was like, wow.
This is awesome.
I turned to my wife.
I go, honey, like there's a lot of people smarter than us.
We're from the east side of San Jose.
We both don't have any college degrees.
Like we're not very smart.
There's 2,000 different companies that were started in the last 50 years and not one person
ever thought of this.
That can't be real.
Right?
Like what's going on?
This doesn't even sound right.
And she goes, do you want the truth?
You want the truth?
Give me answers.
We'll go and never give a shit about their people.
That's why.
Right?
I was like, that's true.
Right?
Because every single person, and Marty says they should, which I agree, every single person
starts a company to get rich.
That's their goal.
I'm going to start a company to get rich.
Luckily, we got rich 19 years ago.
Luckily.
Does that make sense?
So ours was to be number one in the industry.
Do something that's never been done before and take care of our people.
And that's exactly what we're going to do.
Just so you guys know.
So I want to bring up our president, Marty Schaefer.
Come on up here.
All right?
Come on up here.
And then Randy.
Is Randy here?
Where's Randy?
Come on up here, Randy.
All right?
Randy is the amazing, amazing host.
All right?
So Randy is making over a million dollars right now.
Okay?
So let's do Randy as a live example.
We're going to close with this.
Okay?
We're going to close with this.
We're going to do the math.
So this top program was started for someone like Randy or Paul or all of you guys.
Right?
So here's how it works.
And Marty can be the math guy.
He can explain it.
Right?
But let's start because we're going to close with this and we're going to go to dinner.
But I want you guys to know that Randy still didn't make a million a year.
He didn't make a million a month.
But then he also has this upside.
Right?
Remember what Marty said about like everyone thought Levi was crazy for leaving six, seven
million a year.
But now he's already worth 80 million.
Think about that.
Right?
So we're going to explain it.
We're going to make sure because this is just for the EMDs.
I want you to know.
But even more, I want your spouse to know.
Like this is real.
You know what I was thinking driving over here today?
Because I live in San Jose.
So I was driving over here.
I go, what else do we need to do for them to take this seriously?
What else do we need to do for them to go all in?
What else do we need to do for them to work harder?
Like the answer is nothing.
Like we've done it all.
Like literally.
But I promise you we're going to keep doing and doing and doing as much as we can.
But we literally have everything in place.
Marty said the table is set.
The table is set.
Right?
It really is.
All right?
And so let's start just real quick pre-framing.
We're in Southern California in the boardroom with nine advisors and attorneys.
Right?
Remember that?
I do remember that.
So we were a bus lake village and you know, in the boardroom essentially we had a whole gang of lawyers,
accountants, advisors.
And we went around the room and it was really, it was kind of an emotional moment.
I was obviously, honestly nervous for Eric because I was, you know, the idea was turning to paper.
First lawyer says, hey, are you sure you want to do this?
Eric kind of ignores them and says yes.
And they kind of keep, and what they were doing is going around and congratulating Eric.
And they were kind of, this was kind of like the final moment of like, hey, you know, congrats.
It's fun.
And so we get around to the second lawyer and he says the same questions.
Like, hey, Eric, this is a legally binding, it's like 144 pages, legally binding documents,
the central document, the master document.
He says the same question.
He says, Eric, do you really want to do this?
And Eric says, what, you know, kind of walks through that and he kind of churps with the guy.
You think I left a million dollars off?
You think I left a hundred million dollars?
Kind of like, he's like, okay, so nobody else has a question.
I have that, by the way.
And then I look at him and I said, hey, you know, you don't have to do this.
And, you know, as the guy needs to kind of protect the company and protect him, I said, hey, look,
nobody would do this.
You know, you know that.
Like, to his point, people who put, and I knew he was standing in front of putting probably
20, 30 million dollars of capital into the business.
And before that, I'll speak for myself, I don't want to get that back as I deserve, right?
He looks at me and kind of like gives me a look and I'm like, oh, shoot.
And he describes it and he's like, hey, look, I'm good.
I'm good.
And so it was a really, you know, special moment, not only because of the significance of it,
but the severity of the decision, right?
Because this wasn't a sound bite.
This wasn't a PowerPoint.
This was an actual legally binding document.
So it was really, really special.
I mean, I'm impressed that you pulled it off.
I mean, as we sit here today, a guy like Randy, you know, if we can walk through like a big example.
That was good.
I just want to say one thing.
We showed these 72 pages to six other like owners or founders or CEOs of companies or billionaires who are trying to partner with us right now.
And literally all six of the companies were like telling their legal people and their staff, how come we haven't done this?
And a lot of them have left.
They leave after.
They're like, GFI is like a hundred times better.
How come you never did this?
Like their CFOs and CTOs and CEOs are now leaking the companies because they're like, how come you don't have something like this?
Like GFI, right?
I've never said that before.
Yeah.
You haven't said that before.
It's a true story.
We had a billion dollar company that we were still looking at actively partnering with and they lost their seat effort.
They lost a CFO and one of the key executives after they reviewed our documents.
I was like, sorry.
Sorry.
True story.
By the way, when we announced that partnership, that's going to be interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Matt was like, when do we announce it?
When do we announce it?
When do we announce it?
I was like, give it a little while.
I think we'll bring them to Billionaires Island in Hawaii in March.
Yeah.
That would be cool.
All right.
So the next thing I want to mention is there was a guy who flew in from New York to meet
us.
And then they're like, well, what if Eric Olson's like Patrick and David and just sells this big
dream and it just doesn't do anything and all this stuff.
Right?
It was like all this stuff.
And then Greg Kapp was like, this is why GFI was starving because they didn't take care of him at the
practice company.
So he started this.
So we need to take care of our people here.
And he goes into like a 30 minute conversation about doing the right thing for our people.
This is what it's all about.
And Eric was already rich and da, da, da.
He goes 30 minutes.
He goes, I understand that, but whatever.
Right?
And Marty goes, just so you know, that's all real, but he can't change his mind now.
Marty's like, I understand the emotional side of what Greg Kapp said, but just so you
know, he's not allowed to change his mind.
It's all legal documents.
And then the guy goes, okay, makes sense.
Right?
Remember that?
Right?
So I just want you guys to know that it is an emotional thing and it's legal contracts.
It's both.
Right?
And you know why?
It's what Anthony said.
Anthony can comment when Marty says, he goes, this is all you should say when you recruit
people.
And I was like, that's pretty good.
He told Anthony now that he's doing it.
Eric has 50 people that he's known for 20 or 30 or 35 years, including Anthony Rezendez,
Paul Hart, and Randy Sikaios.
50 people who have known for 20, 30, 30, 30 years who are all in business with me.
This is why the POP program exists.
Because I want to take care of our people.
Does that make sense?
Right?
That's what we're doing.
Right?
So now we're going to talk about.
So contextually just to design it in your head looks easier.
I'm going to make a picture guys.

The valuation we currently run off is our email at times whenever we perceive to be reasonable
multiple.
We run various multiple scenarios.
So that would be a good thing.

And then we're going to talk about the company.
And then we're going to talk about the company.
And then we're going to talk about the company.
And then we're going to talk about the company.
And then we take our full 10%.
We don't do it to keep it.
We do it because we've created a tertiary pool.
And that tertiary pool is the top 1,000 agencies each year by pro rata.
And we take our 10%, 100% of our 10% from that pool.
And then the KP senior partner takes 9% of that to retain 81%.
19% goes to this tertiary pool, which we, you know,
a lot of multi-billion dollar transactions, hundreds of millions of dollars likely.
And that would be paid out pro rata.
So you want to be the number one agency in that 1,000.
999's looking to do pretty well.
But what I try and tell people is, you know, if you think about it,
it's like, as Eric said, I tell them, everybody that I know,
and I know every organization, every founder, the way they structure their deals is,
they shouldn't be rich.
And most of them will keep 100% of everything I just described.
In some cases, they get fractional ownership.
So they say, hey, once I get 5% of the company will barbed out,
and we'll fracture that out across so many thousands of people that are eluded.
This is the first ever virtuous cycle where you, if you earn it, you get it.
And it's legally binding.
So we would love to have 100, you know, senior partners.
And you would be able to consider and attach your multiple to our multiple.
So we have this incredible virtuous equity.
So you think of somebody like a million dollar earner, you know, times over 20 or 30 multiples.
Let's just say it's 30.
Obviously, it's a 30 million dollar business.
You take 3 million, goes in a pool.
There are 270, goes in the pool.
So you have $5.7 million going to pay out our agency owners and builders.
And that's a true virtuous cycle.
So the top people who helped us build the organization, the senior partners,
you know, the team of the organization.
So it's pretty extraordinary what we built.
And we're very public about it.
We don't want to hide it.
We have to start to show the documents.
I can't call up PNBC and say, hey, can I see your partnership documents?
I can't call Edward Jones and say, hey, can I see your GP documents?
That's not how it works because we're a real business.
You have to earn your way into that room like Matt, Mario, and Levi did.
Right?
So they sat down and signed and have active LLCs in partnership with us.
So it's really extraordinary.
It's why I love people.
It's why I'm so excited about local building.
Well said.
Give a round of applause.
That's very good.
All right.
So, by the way, Randy's like 99% there.
You'll see, I think we'll be announcing that in the line officially as senior partner.
Just so you guys know, which is pretty awesome.
Pretty awesome.
So here's what I like to put it.
God takes care of GFI because we're God-favored individuals.
GFI.
God takes care of GFI.
GFI then takes care of its minimum 100 senior partners.
Its 100 senior partners takes care of its 1,000 junior partners.
All the junior partners take care of all the EMDs.
And then all the EMDs take care of their mother-in-law for watching the kids the last five years.
Right?
So that's kind of like how it works.
Right?
So a real example.
Here's the crazy part.
We'll put it all the time, energy, effort, money, hire all the staff, negotiate all the contracts,
put together a 10 technologies, do everything, and me and you will get the same multiple.
Yeah, that's crazy.
Right?
Crazy, crazy, crazy.
Right?
So in this example, Randy left.
What were you making when you left?
You left 700 grand a year.
Okay?
Exactly two years later, you're now making 1.1.
All right?
Right?
1.2.
Okay.
1.2.
What's 1.2 times 30?
Anybody good with math or calculator?
What's 1.2 times 30?
Let's do the math.
Let's see right now.
What is it?
36 million.
Okay.
1.2 times 30, 36 million.
Okay?
So Randy right now, two years later is worth 36 million dollars.
Right?
So we've had, by the way, my wife always says, why don't you talk too much?
We've had 19 offers to buy a GFI already.
19.
One of them's with a B.
And I called my advisor and I said, well, you've got only a billion dollars.
They're like, well, it's worth more than that.
And then we did the math and we've already said, hey, we're worth 1.3 billion right now.
So I would have took a pretty good $1 million if I took a billion.
Right?
Pretty crazy.
And so, so right now Randy's worth 36 million.
GFI would then put 10% back in the pool.
Randy then puts 9% back in the pool.
We'll just do easy math and say 20%.
All right.
What's, what's, what's 36 million times 19%.
What does that equal?
36 million times 19%.
Let's do the math.
7, 7 million goes to the pool.
So Randy then gives 7 million to his leaders, his EMBs, his junior partners.
Right?
So you better, you better be coachable.
You better be coachable.
Right?
So he takes 36 million, 29 million net, 7 million goes back in the pool.
Right?
And that's how it works.
By the way, so the reason I told you about the 19 offers is if we would have sold yesterday,
he would have got a check for 36 million.
But then in writing, 29 million he would net and then the other 7 million goes to his people.
Like that's real.
Like no BS.
You understand?
Like that's crazy.
So everyone's like Randy you're crazy leaving 700 grand a year.
Two years later it's worth 36 million.
A year from now it would be worth 50 million.
Two years from now it would be worth 100 million.
Right?
What about, what about Mac Wells up here earlier?
5 million times 30, 150 million.
150 million minus 20%.
His 30 million, he nets 120, 30 million to his team.
Right?
I mean it's crazy.
This is how it works.
We want you to be a senior partner.
What do we have to do?
We're paying you more.
We have better companies, better products, equity program, pop program, better leadership,
better culture.
Like what do we got to do?
Here's the truth.
It's you.
You got to get after it.
You got to get your best.
You got to be on your ABA.
100%.
That's what needs to happen.
And I see some of you are, but I see some of you are not.
Let me just tell you something.
When you're a billionaire or when you're worth 100 million, the same challenges you have
are the same ones you're going to have in the future too.
Neither my honey are fighting.
Well, you fight when you make 100 million too.
Right?
My kids are sick.
Well, they're going to be sick when you're worth 100 million too.
My mom's in the hospital.
Well, it just happens.
Right?
I pray for her.
Does that make sense?
So the point is, how do you handle a person?
You got to go to handle a person.
You can do it.
By the way, when you're on a mission and when you're on a purpose and when you're obsessed
and you have a vision, nothing will stop you.
Make sense?
That's what you got to do.
And you got what it takes.
The question is, are you willing to do it in the house?
So I'm very proud of you, Randy, of what you're doing.
You guys know Randy is one of my closest friends in the world.
I've known him since he was 19 years old and now he's almost 40.
Kind of crazy.
Kind of crazy.
I met him when he was a teenager and now he's almost 40.
But I'm so proud of the man he's become, the businessman he's become, the father he's
become, the father he's become.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's not perfect and you're not either and I'm not even.
Make sense?
Take the good leap of that.
Take the good leap of that.
I'm very proud of you, Randy.
I really appreciate Randy.
Give him a round of applause.
Randy, can you give me a save on this talk program?
Yeah, I just, on the talk program, I saw Eric's heart when it's the floor.

Let me tell you something.
I also have been away from here.
And some of you guys, some of us, don't realize how much we hurt our own businesses by doing
that.
I'm grateful that Eric was able to rally all of us together and pull us away from where
we were.
Because there was no likelihood there.
There was no future.
There was nothing that you're going to pass on to your family.
For example, my daughter.
The day that we found out that Eric was no longer at WG, I'm thinking, if they did
that to him, what's possible for me?
And I think about my daughter, like, all those times, all those calls, all those times that
you were not there or whatever it was, we're all sacrificing every day.
Like, she is not.
It doesn't take over.
We all sold that dream that entire time.
And like, we are one contract to the Eric, and it just shows the dishonesty.
And so I'm just excited to see all of us come together.
But also, just sit there in the back like everything that doesn't make a scene and do it.
So, thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
Last thing I'll say, on the end of the challenge, by the way, a lot of us are in Northern California.
I grew up in Northern California.
We came here.
We're super excited.
Randy's like, come for five minutes and speak.
I was like, no, I'll be here the whole time.
I love this stuff.
That's what I love.
Right?
So, when you love what you do, you're going to work a day of your life.
I'll be here tomorrow as well.
I'll be here tonight for the dinner.
Right?
I'm excited to be here.
Thanks for having me.
But I want you to know that when Santa and I, we're not selling the dream, we're giving you a promise.
Just so you guys know, this is real.
But you need to meet us halfway.
You need to meet us halfway.
So, my ending statement is, there's three things you need to do and we need to do in order to hit this goal of 30-30-30.
Is the vision, we now have it.
The technology, we now have it.
Right?
So, if anybody says, I don't want to do 10 technologies, but you don't want to 30 times multiple then, that's crazy.
Right?
So, 10 technologies, we have it.
The last thing is we don't have yet.
We need massive growth.
Right?
We have 57,000 agents.
We're grofing.
We're doing great.
We need massive, massive growth.
Right?
Peter Kovas texted me last night.
He said, we wouldn't have went public IPO without you.
I said, thank you.
Now it's time to return the payment.
He said, that was our deal.
Right?
Just so you know.
So, I appreciate Peter and he knows everything they do.
So, it's vision, technology, and growth.
Vision, technology, and growth.
We got the vision.
We got the technology.
Now we need the growth.
We need to recruit, build, lead, and compete.
It's time to get after it.
It's time to leave no stone, no turn.
It's time to build your agency.
It's time for you to live up to your potential.
Which I know that you got.
And I'm going to end how I started.
What if everything you've done in your life has prepared you for this moment of you?
I believe it did.
I believe it has.
Thank you guys.
Thank you guys.

Thank you.
Thank you.
