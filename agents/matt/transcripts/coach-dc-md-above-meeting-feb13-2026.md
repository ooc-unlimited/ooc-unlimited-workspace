We have some news to share. Great things are happening. MD and above meeting. So this year, I want you. I to remind me, how many EMDs as a hierarchy are we promoting?

8:05 - Kenneth Mobley Six.

8:07 - COACH DC Who said that? Kenneth said that. Thank you, Kenneth, for knowing that. My EMDs should be the first ones to respond, because this is your MVP promotion. This is your SVP promotion. Johan's got some things up his sleeve, and he might pop out a few EMDs himself. So, with that being said, it's time to rise, it's time to shine. By the way, can you guys come on camera and come behind the blurred backgrounds? I hate those things. I want you guys to be into me. I want to feel like I'm having a business meeting with my number one business partners. 600 licensed agents, and there's 38 of us, which is really 35, because three are my team, my staff. So, I want to have a business meeting. Okay? Let me set the tone here. I want to have a business meeting. No Facebooking, no texting, no driving. Let's be locked in on the meeting. Can we do that? One thing as human beings we have in common is we drift. Let's not drift in this meeting. Because we have some important things to share, some big things are So we're promoting 26 EMD's this year, 26 EMD's this year, which is so exciting, so I want to start off by congratulating our first one of the year, Martha Puche is officially an EMD on the computer, I'm so excited about it, I'm pumped up, congratulations, Martha, congratulations, congratulations, let's go, let's go, thank you everyone, Thank you, thank you, well, I'm excited, I'm super excited, I wanna thank Brian, Maria, Prince, Coach, Caitlin, for the leadership, the support, you know, everything that you guys put in place, obviously this business has ups and downs, but I'm excited, I'm excited what's coming this year, there's so much activity, and I'm excited, that's... That's awesome, that's so awesome, Martha, after our event ended, I, uh, I received a... anonymous phone call from someone who only calls me maybe once a year. Her name was Sandra Olson, and I said, first lady, what do I get? So she was talking about leadership and development, and that was pretty cool. She, I didn't even know you guys knew each other. She said you guys had a good mentor talk and I was great. And then she passed the phone to her husband and Eric said, hey champ, are you ready for an explosion? I said, I'm ready. I'm doing it now. He says, great. He says, well, I'm about to accept a push the button on the EMD promotion. Tell me about this person.

10:31 - Martha Puche Tell me about, like, what do you know about them? I think he was testing if I knew who this person was. I said, all the way down to her son named Franco. He's my buddy, you know what I'm saying?

10:39 - COACH DC So it was a beautiful phone call I had and, you know, gave my lead, gave my leader the green light to push the button. He gave me the green light to accept the promotion. So Martha, big things are here. My sister, it was long overdue. We had some glitches with, with, with home office and switching systems and points. And this fell off and that persistency threw us off for six months over. That's a stupid policy. This should have been happening. We were all frustrated about it, but we're here now.

11:06 - Martha Puche Finally here, yeah.

11:07 - COACH DC We're here now, so I'm proud of you, my sister.

11:09 - Martha Puche Let's go do it. and thank you. Thank you, coach. I appreciate that. Yeah, I had a good conversation with Sandra. Actually, had a talk with Eric as well. And this promotion means a lot, seriously. I mean, it's not just the title, right? It's the learning, the work that was put behind it, the commitment behind the scenes. I told Eric I'm all in, definitely, since day one with Maria, so I'm excited.

11:30 - COACH DC Awesome. That's so good to hear. That's awesome. And right, right, right behind you is Eula. Right behind Eula is Priscilla. Right behind Priscilla is David Aviles. Right behind David Aviles is Tim and Felicia Watts. By the way, I keep saying behind, but it's in no particular order. And if I didn't call on you, you're allowed to join in at any moment, just so you know. I mean, it's, you know, it's an open...

11:50 - Benjamin McCray You good on that flyer.

11:52 - COACH DC Right? I think you guys all will look good on the flyer. So, with that being said, again, kudos to Martha. 1 out of 26 so far. I'm going to put 1 slash 26. I was waiting to this call to announce it, now I'm announcing an EMD text and then remove Martha, it's an annual graduation exit, add her to our EMD thread, we're going to announce it on the Telegram, it's going to be awesome, and we got some gifts already sent to your house, Martha, so it's going to be pretty cool, we're so proud of you, congratulations.

12:17 - Martha Puche Thank you, Coach, thank you, I appreciate it.

12:20 - COACH DC You got it, you got it, all right, who, by the way, who's next? Who's next? You ain't got to be first, you just got to be next, right? You ain't got to be first. You just have to be next. Okay, let's have a meeting, congrats, Martha Puche, super mom, super sister, super friend, and if anybody got your back, it's Martha, when it's time to like have a serious face and get stuff done, Martha helps you get it done, as David Aviles, he's always telling me good fun stories when Martha steps up as a leader and basically just run stuff, okay, it's pretty cool, it's pretty awesome. So anyway, on that note, literally right after that. It's time for us all to grow. It's time for us all to grow. What does grow mean? Get rid of old ways. And rise. It's a lot of old ways that we have to grow out of, and then sometime we relapse and go back into it, but it's all about moving forward. Hey, you know what? I completely forgot about something. Give me one second, guys. This meeting is being recorded. That's fine. You guys, I'm tripping. I dropped the ball on something. I completely forgot that I had this virtual doctor's appointment that Caitlin is at. Our baby turned three months. I only got to be here for 15 minutes. I'll just put it right here. It's fine. It's fine. It's We'll keep going. Oh, my wife don't kill me. You guys, pray that my wife don't kill me. completely forgot. All right. So let's, uh, let's move forward. Rahim, I would love for you. All right. I'm about to ask my EMDs to help me out. need you guys to just buy me a few minutes. Talk about what's coming up Monday. Talk about what's coming up in San Jose at the end of the month. You're doing three trips to San Jose in 30 days, which is crazy. And Rahim, you do a lot of traveling for the team for the business probably more so than most. I would love for you to talk about...

## RAHIM ESMAIL — Events & Mobilization (16:00)

16:00 - Rahim Esmail So, let's talk about a couple of things coming up, right? Some of you guys are going to, on Monday, the Product University. I think it's a great opportunity. Look, any opportunity you can get in front of Eric, we should all take advantage of it. And I'm not just talking about the EMDs, I'm talking about MDs. Guys, these are your opportunities to invest in your business, to get in front of individuals, make connections. Every time, I'll tell you, the last year, I can't even tell you how many city tours I went to, but I will tell you that every one of those city tours, I came with an agenda of some of the things that I had to deal with the home office on. And I would pull John Joseph aside, or I'll take Melinda aside and say, I need these things. And I literally, I will tell you that we were trying to move somebody from one team to another. Both EMDs were in the room. He came up to me. He's like, hey, bro, man, Melinda's here. I'm okay. You're okay. Instead of going through all of the signatures, Let's see if she'll just do it. And she was able to transfer that person on the spot, knowing that, you know, that some of the signatures were already there, so it's easier. There was another issue that Manny was stuck for literally 30 plus days on a certain product. I forget even the name of the product. I think it was American National, if I'm not mistaken. And the product provider was there. I pulled Manny aside, had a conversation. And within 48 hours of that meeting, the policy was issued, commissions released, right? So guys, when you go to these events, meet with individuals, obviously, not just those, make connections with product providers. You're going to be doing your side events that you're going to need sponsorship. And when you start making these connections, and of course, giving them business, that's what's going to work out pretty well. Now let's talk about the CFT Academy and the paper. I'm really excited about it. But when I heard, do you guys understand that Anthony Resendez, the person that's doing the academy is the person that was on Pinnacle staff way back in the day, and I remember we were in the Encino office, and my EMD at that time brought Eric in as an outside speaker, and he talked about that he had Anthony going from one office to another office as a paid employee, helping build offices, build offices, that's when we were doing everything in person. That's what this guy is. That's the knowledge this guy has. So if he's got an academy, and I want you to ask yourself, when that announcement happened, how did you start mobilizing your team? Lance and I went to work immediately, we actually told the team, put an incentive in there, we said, those of you guys are in LA, or if you can get to LA, don't worry about getting there, jump into our 15 passenger van, we're gonna end up taking it. We got 20 people rolling with us to this things. I heard the Galichas got 12 plus individuals on here as well. That's what I'm talking about. Can you imagine 20, 32, I don't know how many, if you guys, if you guys are going to CFT Academy, please, please post it on here, and how many people that you're bringing, imagine how many more CFTs you could have, that's the name of the business guys, is getting people that are independent, so you're not stuck doing all the appointments and babysitting for the rest of your life, so we got 20 people mobilized for that, I just found out, I think Z told me and JR told me that, and Anthony confirmed it yesterday that they're planning another one in Dallas, mid-April, which is going to be awesome, and that's going to be, man, we can get people from the whole country, I know the West Coast, this and that, it is what it is, but now we're going to have Dallas, well guess what, I'm going to mobilize all the people that I'm working with right now, to go to that CFT Academy, and guess what, they can come out of that Academy, do the few more points that they need to do, and they can make a CFT, so imagine that, imagine that, right, and then of course we're excited for our trip to Hawaii, I've been, I made a crusade, I made a goal, guys, that every event that GFI will do, I'm going to be part of, and unfortunately, there was only two events last year that I didn't qualify for, and I told myself, this year I'm qualifying for everything. If there's an incentive trip, I'm going, right? So I love these little things, this picture over here, put it in there. I'm going to go to give the floor to whoever is next, JR, I don't know if you were of things. Go for it, brother.

## JR GALICHA — Events, Carrier Relationships, Spring Retreat (20:28)

20:28 - JR Galicha I appreciate that, Rahim. Appreciate your leadership, appreciate the example, appreciate the bar that you set, that we're all, I mean, you know, you got the target on your back, but I'd rather be, have the target on my back than be the people chasing me, if that makes sense, right? So great job on that, and it's a good bar that you're setting. So we definitely want to compete, but we want to be, we want to not beat each other, but we want to compete with each other on our, at their best. So, you know, if it was a, you know, I won't go too much on that. Let's talk about the events that we got going. Like Rahim said, we're going to, like on Monday, we're going to San Jose, because there's a Carrier University for Anico and American Equity, and they're merging with Brookfield, trillion dollar company, it's a huge deal, super, makes everything even that much more credible, but like you said, you want to get into every opportunity to get into the room where it's more company-wide, because we're always hierarchy, right? But if you can be there in a company-wide setting, it just opens up the whole kind of picture to you, right? And if you can get teammates there as well, it just reinforces that this is not just what you see on Zoom with Ignite or Prolific, there's a whole big world out there in GFI, and you can only get so much of that by attending the trainings, like being in person, seeing Marty in person, seeing Eric in person, he's bigger, he's larger than life, literally, right? And like he said, you can get things done. We had an issue with a policy that charged back for mysterious reasons. I was in Tennessee, I believe, and I just happened to be sitting right next to John Joseph. And I said, hey man, can you help me with this? This doesn't make sense. He looked at it and got it resolved within a couple of days, and I had been chasing that down for weeks. So what he says is true. You can get things going. You can make connections. Like he said, with carriers, you definitely want to build carrier relationships. That's where I build great carrier relationships. This is a tip. You're a future leader. Build these carrier relationships because I'm going to talk about our spring retreat and why that matters. But, you know, I want to jump ahead. So we have the carrier university. We just found out literally in Monterey that Anthony Rosendez, the coach of coaches, literally, he is having a CFT Academy. teaching a system that he rolled out. I'm like, shoot, we're going to be there. And then the great thing is our team was already there. And we had people registering before we even had a chance to promote it, so that's awesome, right? But then we continue to mobilize, and then Dallas, of course, we don't have the dates yet. They thought they did, but they're potentially moving it into the beginning of April. But I'm in touch with Anthony and Laura, his wife, so they're going to update me on that. As well as, I do want to share, Hawaii, I am analyzing the numbers, let's just put it that way. Because whether we make it or not, Sheryl and I are kicking ourselves that we did not make it beyond questionable, like our team totals working on it. I don't know that it's completely finalized yet, with a lot of help from Coach. I just, let's just say that there are some people on the list that qualified that I believe we did better than by the numbers. But anyway, either way, I'm still hoping we go. But if not, no big deal, because we got a lot. We're going on with our spring retreat, which we're in the, we're actually have a planning meeting with our team, I'll just share our flyer with you guys, just so you guys see what it looks like, and so we, our team is going to Seaverville, Tennessee, which is kind of right outside of Knoxville, we got a huge cabin that accommodates over 60 people, and we're just, we're wondering, because we, we've already sold out a quarter of it, and, you know, we have another two or three months to go before we actually have It's going to be a prolific style event, we already have, this is where I said, when, if you're a leader, why you need to have great carrier relationships, is because they will sponsor, they will help pay for food, they will, they will come and speak to your team, provide swag, we've already set all that up, right, so that's just big leadership tip, get to know you on a first name basis, I don't mean just say, hey, Chris, Chris Revis, he's the, the guy from FNG, we get to know So family gets to know, like become friends with them, because guess what, if they have, they're all people, if they have a stack of items that they need to push forward, and they have a finite amount of time to do it, if you're friends with them, they're human. Do you think they'll get a little bit up the priority list? Every little bit counts, right? And I forgot to mention one more thing, since we're talking about FNG, Sheryl and I personally were very excited because we qualified, and we didn't even know there was a contest, but we qualified to go to Cabo. actually it's next week for top six producers in the company, in FNG. So that's, you know, we're just fired up, lots of travel. We're just trying to keep it all, like, kind of organized and head down and working. And, you know, we still got our family, I got five kids, my son's super competitive in basketball. Two year old baby, basically, you can get it all done, right? You can get it all done. That's why when somebody says they're busy, or they got this. Or So they got that, I get, I'm like, I don't, you know, I, I acknowledge it, but it's, you know, I don't really, it's, it's, do you want this, it's a priority, it's succeeding in this business a priority for you, I can tell you, am up at five, six o'clock in the morning, actually, that's a little late for me, Patience is getting texts from me at four o'clock my time in the morning, it's weird, it's obsessive, I get it, it's just what it is, I wake up and I have this thought planted in my mind, and I gotta get working on it already, right, so, I know I sound a little obsessed with it, but that's kind of what you got to be, right, if you want to hit these milestones, you're not going to hit three, five, 700,000 in income, million dollars in income without that level of obsession, at least that's my belief. Anyway, I'll let Brian take it away, I talk too much. Take it away, man.

## BRIAN AVILA — Obsession, Mobilization, Austin Expansion (26:47)

26:47 - Brian Avila All right, good stuff, JR, great stuff that you have going on with your team and Raheem as well, so yeah, I'll be pretty quick on mine as well, I'm really fired up about everything that's coming up, and here's where everything's going to start. All right, guys, so we got to become obsessed, right, like really obsessed, when's the last time you were obsessed at something, and this business is probably the right thing you should obsess about, because other than this, what else is supposed to give you a better future, right, and so we have all these resources, all these events coming up, and every one of you guys has amazing EMDs that is putting events like these together. GFI puts events together, and the EMD puts events. But I'll say something for our EMDs that they won't say themselves, but the biggest mobilizers need to be the MDs, the marketing directors. That's your position, a marketing director. It can't just be JR and Sheryl promoting their event, right, and then you guys just, yes, I'll be there, and then not mobilizing it on you guys' chats or not reaching out to your sidelines, because the increase of culture as a whole is what's going to become attractive to your future recruits. When you start looking at your business like an investment, you start thinking to yourself every... Everything that JR Shell, everything Rahim does, and that their whole hierarchy does as a whole, will impact the newest recruit that I get in the next 24 hours or next month. And so once you understand that, you'll start becoming such a big mobilizer to these events that they're putting together, right? So make sure if you're here as a marketing director under any of your EMDs, you should be the biggest person mobilizing to these events and get competitive. Who has the most amount? Who has the most amount of guests or agents, I'm sorry, that you get to the event? You're the marketing director. They're executive marketing directors, so we think that should be their only role, but you're up next. So if you're not doing any marketing for these events that they're putting together, that they're putting together, and by the way, they're doing free stay for people that just do what they're supposed to be doing in the business, that's crazy to me, right? So qualify and then mobilize. That's the only thing that I will say for that. Now, here's another thing I'm going to mention. And so I want to... I sure that as prolific, we go from corner to corner, right? Corner to corner in the country, from East Coast to West Coast, and that's one of the reasons why I came to Austin, Texas, because there's really nobody making noise out here. There's like one little ring-a-ding-a company over here, and they're not even proud to say who they are. You know, if you're in GFI, if you're here, and we're a part of the number one team in all of GFI, I hope you guys are walking around speaking with true conviction, because there are some companies out there that don't even want to say who they're a part of. I to say the name of their company, because the branding that they have does not back them up, right? You know, I had an individual that I just spoke to. They said, yeah, I just spoke to somebody, and they kept giving me the runaround. And it turns out that, you know, they mentioned, oh yeah, I work with, after a while, I work with Integrity, but it was PHP, right? And so not to mention it, but yeah, it was PHP, right? And so in GFI, you know what I love? That we are so proud of who we are. We are so proud of who we are. So mobilize the heck out of that, mobilize the heck out of prolific. Number one team in all of GFI, right, which is awesome, so Austin Takeover, that's my plan, you know, I have, I met up with Terrence the other day, and I'm excited to do some great things with Terrence to leverage a lot of his expertise, you know, he'll learn from me, I'll learn from him, I have a pretty nice sized team over here in Austin as well, and we're going to be doing a lot of events in person, and so if you prospect somebody in this area, maybe you're on social media, right, like I see Tiana on social media, anyone that you prospect, you could literally recruit someone and then just introduce them to us over here, and we'll build an in-person bond with them, so that can help you guys retain these individuals, and I'll be doing a lot of events with people in person, like tomorrow, we're doing a little Valentine something, just get together with a team out here, and so anyone you prospect out here, that's your team, you recruit them, but we can help make the culture stick a little bit stronger by hanging out with them over here, including them in our events, etc., and May, just like JR and...

## COACH DC — Calendar, EMD Promotions, Numbers, Deliberate Intention (33:00+)

33:00 - COACH DC So, when you have deliberate intention, look at what I'm doing, I never, like, I'm getting so much better at my schedule, I'm like, alright, let show the team where I'm at, what I'm doing, so here, where we are now, we are here, um, Cabo trip, not going, but I will go to Hawaii, with Rahim and Leila, with Zia Maria, that's gonna be awesome, after that, Martha will be in San Diego, San in May, by the way, I love, and I have a, uh, EM, and that's what I was supposed to do, Martha, that's really what Eric told me to do, but I'll, actually, I'll text you offline, we gotta do an interview, um, as an EMD, you guys, write this down, the higher we go and grow in our business, the more responsibility is added to our plate, so, meaning, my intensity with you only goes up, my challenges with you only goes up. You understand? So, with that being said, there's, again, to whom much is given, much is required. So now that Martha's in EMD, I'm not going to ask her to be here. She knows she has to be here. It's the graduation for all the newest EMDs in GFI, not prolific, in GFI, right? So my point is, be preparing your guys as they grow that more is coming with it.

### EMD Promotion Targets

- **Eula** — next in line
- **Priscilla Zhang** — right behind

### EMD Graduation Dates
- **Q1** — March 31st cycle
- **Q2** — June 30th cycle  
- **November 30th** — special graduation

### MD & Above Meeting Schedule (Quarterly)
- **May 15, 2026** — next meeting
- **August 14, 2026**
- **November 13, 2026**

### Key Numbers Shared
- **Terrence Taylor** — led personal production last month ($8,800, no recruiting)

- **Tiana & Patience** — youngest MDs, five figures last month (10K+ = MD standard)

- **Josh & Lana expecting a baby boy**

### Deliberate Intention Framework
DC's core teaching for the meeting:
1. **Mid-month/mid-quarter check-ins** — don't wait until end of month
2. **Meet with your people intentionally** — 10-15 minute Zooms, not always hour-long meetings
3. **Phone zones** — Sunday after church, call 2-4 people, get on Zoom, make calls together
4. **Push people to Next Wave and Frontline** — break it down to minimums
5. **Next Wave** = 5,000 points + 1 direct recruit per quarter
6. **Frontline** = 25,000 points + 6 directs per quarter
7. **Drag them across the finish line** — be specific about what each person needs

### Path to Partnership — Company Rankings

- Top 100 starts at only ~$209K cash flow
- #71 is at $284K — "one fat sale" difference

- Top names: Resendez at $650K, Matt Sloss at $474K, Johnny Sepulveda at $450K

## UPDATED PROLIFIC SYSTEM — Onboarding 1, 2, 3 (1:12:00+)

### Background
- DC met with Matt Welsh (Field Chairman) for 2 hours over the weekend
- First system update in **4 years and 2 months** (since December 2021)
- Welsh cut out ~80% of old content — streamlined
- Combined GFI company lingo with Prolific system
- Will add technology (Agency Rocket, iDecide, CFT bootcamp tech) later

### The System Flow
1. **Recruit** → Associate $199
2. **Schedule exam** (7-10 days out)
3. **Client experience** (for 2 reasons: know what you're getting licensed to do + help your family financially)
4. **117** (contract)
5. **Pass exam**
6. **Post-licensing process**

### For Licensed Agents Coming In
- Skip licensing steps
- Go straight to client experience
- "You're starting ahead of everybody — you get to skip these boxes"
- Practice what you preach — get them on GFI products (upgrade from Transamerica to North American, etc.)

### Onboarding 1 (Personal, 1-on-1)
- Done within 48 hours of getting agent code
- Schedule exam
- Client experience (4 buckets, IUL Family Bank, flagship products)
- Baby analogy: "Most important days are the first 7" — text me every day, I text you
- Tell them what's next: "Tuesday, your first class is orientation"
- **Can take 45 min to 90 min** — don't rush it ("we can't microwave leaders")
- OK to split into two sessions if needed

### Onboarding 2 (After License)
- Business plan
- Set grand opening date
- Set net license date
- Set CFT date
- Deliberate intention — go ballistic on setting appointments after grand opening

### Onboarding 3 (Post-Grand Opening) — NEW
- **This is the breakthrough** — DC never had a "post-grand opening" before
- "If we get them to onboarding 3, they'll be an EMD"
- They've done all the awkward stuff (3-way texts, became client, spouse meeting, grand opening)
- Now teach them the SYSTEM: compensation, contracts, 5 ways to gain clients
- Action steps: send 3-way texts with CPAs, teachers, etc.
- System progression tracker
- Scripts for objections (Does my spouse need to be there? Is this MLM? Do I need to buy anything?)

### T3 (Tuesday Team Training) Structure — 6 Breakout Rooms Max
1. **Orientation** — industry overview, GFI story, company vision
2. **Grand Opening** — prep, scripts, practice
3. **Onboarding 1** — system walkthrough (taught by MDs/EMDs)
4. **Onboarding 2** — business plan class
5. **Onboarding 3** — post-grand opening, field training, expansion
6. (Optional — prospecting, social media, etc.)

### Key Principles
- **Tuesday T3** = System, agency building, recruiting
- **Thursday T2** = Technical/financial (carrier trainings, product education)
- **Field training** is where product education happens — not Zoom classes
- Don't send new agents to financial trainings until net license+
- Keep new agent mindset on **rapid expansion**, not products
- "Scenario of disaster" should be in the **recruiting interview** (not onboarding)

### Teva Discussion
- Digital PFR not ready yet — numbers off, states wrong, can't access client data
- Beta testing in progress, new developers hired
- **Don't make blanket rollout** — use it personally, but don't push hierarchy-wide until March/April/May
- Still do it for the $500 bonus — fill it out after the fact if needed
- Gary asked about Teva: "The unspoken code — if Coach don't roll it out, it's probably not ready yet"

### Staff/Operations
- Karen (assistant) sends welcome email same day as ICA
- Includes: welcome message, Instagram, Ethos personal website, state requirements
- 3-way text with upline/recruiter
- Schedule licensing call
- **Google Drive being created** for Prolific — all slides, templates, emails, announcements
- First time in 4 years DC is sharing this openly

### Leadership Nuggets
- "The system takes the thinking out of our business"
- "If we gotta think about what's next, we're not running a system"
- "We're winging leadership — not anymore, this is intentional"
- "Deliberately generate activity — get on Zoom with 2 senior associates, don't get off until you book 5 appointments"
- "Reach down and pull up" — call people in your base shop randomly
- "Check in, check in, check in" — Rahim does this at $400K income, why aren't you?
- "If nothing changes, nothing changes"
- "Every day is one LESS day, not one MORE day"
- "We don't have one more day towards EMD — you got one less day"
- "Sundays after church — all base shop phone zones"
- Pass responsibility DOWN — CFTs, MDs should be doing onboardings, not just EMDs
- Spouses should become operations day one
